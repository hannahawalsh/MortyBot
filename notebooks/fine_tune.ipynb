    "# Model Fine Tuning\n",
    "---\n",
    "I think that GPT can generate the best description of what fine tuning is. Here is what it output when asked:  \n",
    "> Fine-tuning a GPT model means adjusting the model's parameters on a smaller dataset in order to adapt it to a specific task. The model is already pre-trained on a large dataset, but it may not be perfectly suited for the specific task it's being used for. Fine-tuning allows the model to learn additional information from a smaller dataset so that it can perform better on the specific task.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> For example, imagine a GPT model was pre-trained on a large dataset of general text, such as Wikipedia articles. If you want to use this model for a specific task like language translation, you would fine-tune it on a smaller dataset of translated text. This would allow the model to learn additional information about how the languages relate to one another, and it would help the model translate more accurately.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> In summary, fine-tuning is a way to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task by training it further with a smaller dataset. This allows the model to improve its performance on the specific task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in our case, we want to fine-tune our model on mortgage information to help a borrower complete a mortgage application.  "

    "We have chosen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as our fine-tuning data set. We scraped text from their website in the `scrape_cfpb_website` notebook. In the future, we'd want to augment this with additional information about American mortgages. Basically, the more data, the better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we create the training data, we need to format it as \"prompt\" (what the user would type in) and \"completion\" (what the model would return). Fortunately, the structure from the CFPB website is perfectly suited for this application as its articles are titled with questions. For its \"key terms,\" we create questions that ask what the term means. We randomly generate different forms of the question so that the model doesn't always expect a question in the exact same format (e.g., \"what is \\___?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's API expects the data in a very specific format. The question has to end with a \"prompt stop\" that tells the model that this is the end of the question. It has to be characters that aren't in any of the questions we are training on or likely to be in a user's question. We chose to use `\\nX0X\\n` as our stop. We also have to provide a \"completion stop\" that tells the model that it should stop answering the question. We chose `###` for our completion stop. Additionally, because of how tokenization works, all completions have to start with a whitespace.  \n",

An appraisal is a professional opinion about the value of your property. An appraisal can help lenders determine if your loan application is likely to be approved. Appraisals are usually required when a loan amount exceeds a certain percentage of the home's value, such as 80 percent or 90 percent. If you have an issue with your mortgage, you should discuss it with your lender as soon as possible. You can also submit a complaint to the CFPB online or by calling.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the qualifications for a VA loan?\nAnswer:\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) guarantees the loans. The VA has a number of rules that must be followed when taking out a VA loan. These rules include: You must be a veteran or have been discharged under honorable conditions from active duty in the U. S. Armed Forces, and have served at least 90 days on active duty or been discharged due to a service-connected disability; You must be using the home as your principal residence; You cannot use the home as collateral for another loan; If you are using the home as your principal residence, you cannot use it for any purpose other than as your principal residence (for example, you can't rent it out); If you are using the home as your principal residence, you cannot use it for any purpose other than as your principal residence (for example, you can't rent it out); If there is more than one borrower on a mortgage application and one borrower is eligible for benefits under Chapter 33 of title 38 U. S. Code (known as \"GI Bill\" benefits), then all borrowers on that application are eligible for those benefits;\n\n"

Like a conventional loan, an FHA loan generally requires a down payment and offers the borrower more flexibility in how the money is used. Unlike most conventional loans, however, an FHA mortgage may be available to borrowers who do not have good credit or enough cash for a 20 percent down payment. The FHA does not require that you have good credit to qualify for an FHA mortgage. However, if you do not have good credit or enough cash for 20 percent down payment on your home purchase, it may be difficult to get approved by most lenders and find someone willing to purchase your home with only 10 percent of its value as collateral (\n\n"

If you are interested in getting a mortgage, it's a good idea to shop around for the best deal. You can do this by comparing rates and fees from several lenders or by shopping for the best deal on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). To get multiple quotes, use our homebuying tool.

FHA loans are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insures most conventional loans. FHA loans are generally more affordable than conventional loans. However, they do require a down payment and may have higher interest rates than other types of mortgages. If you're interested in getting an FHA loan, it's important to shop around and compare rates before choosing an lender or mortgage broker.

The programs have different rules and requirements, but generally a loan that is a conforming loan will be eligible for special benefits such as lower interest rates and other benefits.  A non-conforming mortgage may or may not meet all of the rules for a particular program, but it does not qualify as a conforming mortgage under any federal housing program.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long does the application process take?\nAnswer:\nThe application process for a mortgage takes about three business days.

LTV is the amount of your mortgage loan that is greater than or equal to the appraised value of your home.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy is my lender requiring a house appraisal?\nAnswer:\nA lender may require a house appraisal if you are applying for a mortgage loan. The appraisal is used to determine the value of your home and whether you qualify for the loan. If you have questions about an appraisal, contact your lender or real estate agent.\n\nQuestion:\nWhere do I find my W-2?\nAnswer:\nYour W-2 is the form that you receive from your employer each year. It shows how much you earned and how much tax was withheld from your pay. You can also get a copy of your W-2 by calling the IRS or visiting an IRS service center. If you have a problem with your W-2, call the IRS right away to report it.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the qualifications for a VA loan?\nAnswer:\nTo qualify for a VA loan, you must be a veteran or have certain service-connected disabilities. You also must be at least 18 years old and not more than 100 percent disabled. If you are married, your spouse may also qualify for the loan. The VA will consider your income and assets when deciding whether to approve your application. If you are approved, the VA will send you an offer of benefits that includes a \"Notice of Benefits\" (NOB). This NOB is important because it tells you how much money the VA will pay on your behalf if you accept their offer of benefits. The NOB does not include any fees or charges that may apply to the loan; those fees and charges are listed in the \"Fees and\n\nQuestion:\nHow many planets are there?\nAnswer:\nThe number of planets in our solar system is not known with certainty. There are many different ways to count the number of planets, and different groups use different methods. The most commonly used method is to count the number of stars that have been observed to have planets orbiting them. This method has led some scientists to estimate that there are about 100 billion (1010) stars in our galaxy, and about 200 billion (2×1010) stars in the Milky Way alone. If we assume that each star has a planet orbiting it, then there would be about 100 billion (1010) planets in our galaxy alone. However, this does not mean that all these planets would be similar to Earth or even habitable by life as we know it;\n\nQuestion:\nHow many planets are there in my milk glass?\nAnswer:\nThere are approximately 1,000 known planets in our Milky Way galaxy. The number of planets in your milk glass is not a good estimate of how many planets there are in the universe. The number of stars and planets is much larger than the number of milk glasses.  Milk glass is made from molten glass that cools very quickly, so it doesn't have time to form a solid crust like other types of glass do. This means that when you break a milk glass, it breaks into tiny pieces that can be easily lost or thrown away. If you want to know how many stars there are in our galaxy, check out this article on star counts for more information about how astronomers measure star counts and what they mean for us here on Earth.\n\n"

With an adjustable rate mortgage, the interest rate can change, usually for a specified period of time. The interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) can change once the initial fixed-rate period ends and the new interest rates begin to adjust. The initial fixed-rate period is called the \"initial lock\". After that, there is a \"reset\" or \"adjustment\" of the interest rates every so often called a \"maturity\". If you have an ARM with no initial lock, your monthly payments will increase as your loan's balance increases over time because your payment will be higher than what it would have been if you had chosen a fixed-rate loan at\n\nQuestion:\nCan you explain the difference between a conforming and non-conforming loan?\nAnswer:\nA conforming loan is a loan that meets certain requirements set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The FHFA sets these requirements to make sure that loans made through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) are safe and sound. A non-conforming loan is a loan that does not meet these requirements.\n\nQuestion:\nHow long does the application process take?\nAnswer:\nThe application process for a mortgage loan generally takes three business days or less. If you are applying for a mortgage with a national bank or savings association, the application process generally takes five business days or less. If you are applying for a mortgage with an industrial loan company, the application process generally takes 15 business days or less.\n\n"

With a fixed-rate mortgage, you know how long you will have to pay the loan back for. This is called the \"term\". The longer your term, the more likely it is that your monthly payments will be higher than with an adjustable rate mortgage. With an adjustable rate mortgage, your interest rate can change over time. When it does change, it can be higher or lower than what you originally agreed to pay for the loan. If your interest rate does not change as much as with an adjustable rate mortgage and if you have a longer term on your loan (meaning that more of the loan has already been paid off), then this type of loan may be cheaper in total cost over time compared to an ARM.\n\n"
