      "\n",
      "Know Your Rights, look for notices, ask questions. You may want to consult an attorney. If your landlord stops paying the mortgage, foreclosure proceedings may begin. Some state and local laws may offer protections for renters in the foreclosure process. More information about landlord-tenant laws in your state is available as well as a summary of state and local tenant protections from foreclosure. Tip:If you need help finding an attorney, you can view this list ofresources from the American Bar Association and you can find your local legal aid office or volunteer attorney program. Be aware of the following: Look for notices. If notices of a possible foreclosure are delivered to or posted on your property, contact the sender right away and let them know that you are a tenant. You should also contact your landlord. Ask questions. You may get confusing information from your landlord about the foreclosure. For example, the landlord may ask you to prepay your rent in violation of your lease or rental agreement. Your landlord may also tell you that the foreclosure is a \"mistake,\" or say that the problem has been resolved. To be sure, check with the office where deeds are recorded in the county where the property is located. \"Land records,\" \"auditor,\" \"recorder,\" or \"assessor\" are names commonly used to describe the office where a foreclosure notice or other document (often called a \"lis pendens\") has been recorded. You may also want to check court filings against your landlord. Know Your Rights. During the foreclosure process, you need to know what your options are under your state and local laws. They can vary greatly from state to state. In order to decide what to do, you may want to know:How long the foreclosure may take; How much time you have to move after a foreclosure sale; If there are any other specific tenant protections in your state. How long the foreclosure may take; How much time you have to move after a foreclosure sale; If there are any other specific tenant protections in your state. You may be able to get some of this information by calling the local courthouse. Rent control/Just cause eviction and Section 8. If your state or local laws have rent control or \"just cause eviction\" requirements, you may be protected from eviction after foreclosure. \"Just cause\" laws limit the reasons a landlord can terminate a lease or evict a tenant. Depending on the state or local law, the foreclosure alone may not justify an eviction or termination of your lease or rental agreement. If you have a Section 8 Voucher, contact your local Housing Authority and a legal aid lawyer immediately. Usually, Section 8 leases can only be terminated for good cause, which means that you can't be evicted just because of a foreclosure. But you may need a lawyer to protect your rights. Utility shut-offs. If your landlord is unable to pay the mortgage, the landlord may also not be paying the utilities, and your utility service may be shut-off. You should immediately contact the utility and the landlord if a shut-off notice is sent or if your utilities are shut off. You may be able to avoid the shut-off by contacting the utility and directly paying them, even if the utilities are in the landlord's name. Move. Once a foreclosure sale occurs, you may be required to move, often in as little as thirty days or less. You should remove all of your belongings when you move so the new property owner does not take or destroy them. Protect yourself. If someone contacts you claiming to be the new property owner, ask to see documents that show ownership. Do this before paying rent, signing a new lease agreement, or allowing them to come inside the property. Scammers review publicly available foreclosure recordings and may contact tenants living in foreclosed properties to falsely demand rent. Negotiate. If the new owner wants you to move out, ask if they will give you some money to help pay moving expenses. This is sometimes referred to as a \"cash for keys\" agreement. Sometimes the bank or the new owner after a foreclosure sale is willing to do this. Deposits. If your landlord was not paying the mortgage, it may be difficult for you to get back any money you paid to your landlord as a deposit or prepaid rent. If the landlord did not refund your deposit or transfer it to the new owner after the foreclosure sale, you may need to take legal action to get back your deposit.\n"

       "179  If your spouse or person living with you is a co-borrower If you move out of your home for any reason such as to live in a nursing home, or downsize to a smaller house and your spouse or the person living with you is a co-borrower on the reverse mortgage loan, they can stay in the home and continue to receive loan disbursements as long as they fulfill the ongoing obligations of the reverse mortgage. If your spouse or person living with you isn't a co-borrower If your spouse or partner is not a co-borrower and you move someplace else for the majority of the year, the reverse mortgage loan will need to be paid back. The most common way to pay back a reverse mortgage is by selling the home, in which case your spouse or partner will have to move. If you are away from your home and in a healthcare facility such as a hospital, assisted living, nursing home, or rehabilitation center for more than 12 consecutive months, your non-borrowing spouse may be able to stay in the home without paying off the loan, depending on when you took out (\"originated\") the loan. and whether they qualify as an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse under HUD's rules. Qualifying as an \"Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse\" can be difficult, so your spouse may want to consider contacting an attorney or HUD-approved housing counseling agency.

       "62  Do I ever have to buy property or flood insurance from my lender? No. You may shop for property or flood insurance. But if you do not get homeowner's insurance, or let your policy lapse, your lender may insure your property and charge you for it. This is called \"force-placed\" or \"collateral protection\" insurance. It is usually much more expensive than a regular policy. A lender may also buy \"force-placed\" flood insurance for homeowners in flood zones who do not have adequate flood insurance to meet the legal minimum required to protect the property. If you can obtain your own insurance, it will generally be less expensive than the insurance bought by your lender for you. In some cases of force-placed insurance, the policy that the lender buys protects their interest but not your interest in the property. If you believe that any force-placed insurance was purchased in error, you should contact your lender immediately and give proof of your current insurance policy. Tip: If you disagree with your lender's determination that you need flood insurance, you can review the FEMA flood maps. If you think there has been an error, you can ask FEMA to issue a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), or a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F). If your loan doesn't include an escrow account, you will have to plan for potentially large property-related expenses, such as property taxes and homeowner's insurance premiums. Be sure you budget for your monthly mortgage payments plus these extra costs and stay current on your taxes and insurance payments. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may impose fines and penalties or place a tax lien on your home. In addition, if you fail to pay any of your property-related costs, your lender may add the amounts to your loan balance, add an escrow account to your loan, or require you to pay for insurance on your home that your lenders buys on your behalf, which likely would be more expensive and provide fewer benefits than what you could obtain on your own.
