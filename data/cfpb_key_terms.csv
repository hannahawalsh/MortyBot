Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM),"An adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of loan for which the interest rate can change, usually in relation to an index interest rate.

Amortization,"Amortization means paying off a loan with regular payments over time, so that the amount you owe decreases with each payment.

If payments are less than the amount of interest due each month, the mortgage balance will grow rather than decrease. This is called negative amortization. Other loan programs that do not amortize fully during the loan may require a large, lump sum ""balloon"" payment at the end of the loan term. Be sure you know what type of loan you are getting.
