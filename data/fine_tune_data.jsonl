{"prompt":"Explain repayment plan.\nX0X\n","completion":" A repayment plan is a structured way to make up your missed mortgage loan payments over a certain period of time. This is a type of loss mitigation. If you have trouble making your mortgage payments, your lender or servicer may allow you to enter into a repayment plan. Before entering into a repayment plan, make sure you understand the requirements of the plan and whether you will be able to make the new payments.###"}
{"prompt":"Define reverse mortgage\nX0X\n","completion":" A reverse mortgage allows homeowners age 62 or older to borrow against their home equity. It is called a \"reverse\" mortgage because, instead of making payments to the lender, you receive money from the lender. The money you receive, and the interest charged on the loan, increases the balance of your loan each month. Most reverse mortgages today are called HECMs, short for Home Equity Conversion Mortgage. Find out what you should consider before applying for a reverse mortgage.###"}
{"prompt":"What does right of rescission mean?\nX0X\n","completion":" The right of rescission refers to the right of a consumer to cancel certain types of loans. If you are buying a home with a mortgage, you do not have a right to cancel the loan once the closing documents are signed. However, if you are refinancing a mortgage, you have until midnight of the third business day after the transaction to rescind (cancel) the mortgage contract. The three-day clock does not start until you sign the credit contract (usually called the promissory note), you receive a Truth in Lending disclosure form, and you receive two copies of a notice explaining your right to rescind.###"}

{"prompt":"What does servicer mean?\nX0X\n","completion":" Your mortgage servicer is the company that sends you your mortgage statements. Your servicer also handles the day-to-day tasks of managing your loan. Your loan servicer typically processes your loan payments, responds to borrower inquiries, keeps track of principal and interest paid, and manages your escrow account (if you have one). The loan servicer may initiate foreclosure under certain circumstances. Your servicer may or may not be the same company that originally gave you your loan.###"}
{"prompt":"Explain shared appreciation mortgage.\nX0X\n","completion":" Under a shared appreciation mortgage, you agree to give your lender a share of any increase in the value of your home. ###"}
{"prompt":"Define short sale\nX0X\n","completion":" A short sale is a sale of your home for less than what you owe on your mortgage. A short sale is an alternative to foreclosure, but because it is a sale, you will have to leave your home. If your lender or servicer agrees to a short sale, you may be able to sell your home to pay off your mortgage, even if the sale price or proceeds turn out to be less than the balance remaining on your mortgage. A short sale is a type of loss mitigation. If you live in a state in which you are responsible for any deficiency, which is the difference between the value of your property and the amount you still owe on your mortgage loan, you will want to ask your lender to waive the deficiency. If the lender waives the deficiency, get the waiver in writing and keep it for your records.###"}

{"prompt":"What are my rights as a servicemember under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act? Can a creditor refuse to extend credit to me just because I'm a servicemember?\nX0X\n","completion":"  It depends. Service in the military - whether current or prior service - is not a protected class under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). But just like your civilian counterparts, you are covered by the ECOA.

This includes, but is not limited to, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), unemployment compensation, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits (SNAP). Some Veterans' benefits may also be considered income from a public assistance program (in which case no creditor may discriminate against a veteran on the basis of receiving such benefits). Whether you've exercised in good faith a right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA). The CCPA is a collection of consumer protection laws, including ECOA, relating to credit; Some state laws do make it illegal to discriminate against covered persons based on active duty or veteran\/military status.

{"prompt":"Will I receive the Know Before You Owe disclosures when I shop for a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you applied for a mortgage on or after Oct. 3, 2015, you should have received the forms in most cases. The CFPB has created interactive tools and resources to help you shop for a mortgage, review your Loan Estimate, and review your Closing Disclosure. We also have adownloadable step-by-step guide. OurKnow Before You Owe mortgage initiativeempowers consumers with the information they need to make informed mortgage choices. Under this initiative, we have consolidated the mortgage disclosures required under federal law in two forms. The disclosure forms are called the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure. The Loan Estimate is provided early in the mortgage process, within three business days of your application. The Closing Disclosure is provided at the end of the process, and you must receive it at least three business days before closing. These new forms replace the old federal mortgage disclosures, known as the Good Faith Estimate, the HUD-1 Settlement Statement, and the Truth in Lending disclosures. If you applied for a mortgage before Oct. 3, 2015, you will receive the old forms even if you close after Oct. 3, 2015. Certain kinds of mortgages are not covered by the new forms. You will not receive a Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure if you are shopping for: A reverse mortgage; A home equity line of credit (HELOC); A manufactured housing or mobile home loan not secured by real estate; A subordinate loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs; For these kinds of loans, you should receive Truth-in-Lending disclosures. If you are shopping for a reverse mortgage, you will also receive a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and a HUD-1 Settlement Statement.###"}
{"prompt":"What exactly happens when a mortgage lender checks my credit?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The credit check is reported to the credit reporting agencies as an \"inquiry\". Inquiries tell other creditors that you are thinking of taking on new debt. An inquiry typically has a small, but negative, impact on your credit score. Inquiries are a necessary part of applying for a mortgage, so you can't avoid them altogether. But it pays to be smart about them. As a general rule, apply for credit only when you need it. Applying for a credit card, car loan, or other type of loan also results in an inquiry that can lower your score, so try to avoid applying for these other types of credit right before getting a mortgage or during the mortgage process. Learn more about credit scores You can shop around for a mortgage and it will not hurt your credit Within a 45-day window, multiple credit checks from mortgage lenders are recorded on your credit report as a single inquiry. This is because other creditors realize that you are only going to buy one home. You can shop around and get multiple preapprovals and official Loan Estimates. The impact on your credit is the same no matter how many lenders you consult, as long as the last credit check is within 45 days of the first credit check. Even if a lender needs to check your credit after the 45-day window is over, shopping around is usually still worth it. The impact of an additional inquiry is small, while shopping around for the best deal can save you a lot of money in the long run. Note: the 45-day rule applies only to credit checks from mortgage lenders or brokers' credit card and other inquiries are processed separately. You can check your own credit with no impact on your score When you check your own credit - whether you're getting a credit report or a credit score - it's handled differently by the credit reporting agencies and does not affect your credit score. If you are applying for a mortgage and haven't already checked your credit report for errors, do so now. You can get a free copy of your credit report at www. annualcreditreport. com. If you find any errors, get them corrected as soon as possible.###"}
{"prompt":"How much does it cost to receive a Loan Estimate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The only fee a lender can ask you to pay prior to providing aLoan Estimateis a fee for obtaining your credit report. Credit report fees are typically less than $30. The Loan Estimate is a form that went into effect on Oct. 3, 2015. A lender cannot collect any other fees before providing you with a Loan Estimate. In fact, a lender must wait until you indicate that you'd like to proceed with the loan application before charging you any other fees. Until that time, a lender also cannot collect your credit card number or require you to provide a check for anything other than a reasonable fee to obtain your credit report. Once you receive a Loan Estimate, it's up to you to decide whether you want to proceed with that particular lender and that particular loan application. If you have received your Loan Estimate and you tell the lender that you want to proceed, then the lender can charge you additional fees. For example, lenders commonly charge an application fee or an appraisal fee after you decide to proceed with the loan application. Learn how to proceed with a Loan Estimate. See a sample Loan Estimate form with interactive tips and definitions. You won't receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to Oct. 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate.

{"prompt":"What is a Loan Estimate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A Loan Estimate is a three-page form that you receive after applying for a mortgage. The Loan Estimate tells you important details about the loan you have requested. The lender must provide you a Loan Estimate within three business days of receiving your application. The Loan Estimate is a form that took effect on Oct. 3, 2015. The form provides you with important information, including the estimated interest rate, monthly payment, and total closing costs for the loan. The Loan Estimate also gives you information about the estimated costs of taxes and insurance, and how the interest rate and payments may change in the future. In addition, the form indicates if the loan has special features that you will want to be aware of, like penalties for paying off the loan early (a prepayment penalty) or increases to the mortgage loan balance even if payments are made on time (negative amortization). If your loan has a negative amortization feature, it appears in the description of the loan product. The form uses clear language and design to help you better understand the terms of the mortgage loan you've applied for. All lenders are required to use the same standard Loan Estimate form. This makes it easier for you to compare mortgage loans so that you can choose the one that is right for you. When you receive a Loan Estimate, the lender has not yet approved or denied your loan application. The Loan Estimate shows you what loan terms the lender expects to offer if you decide to move forward. If you decide to move forward, the lender will ask you for additional financial information. See a sample Loan Estimate form with interactive tips and definitions. Note:You won't receive a Loan Estimate if you're applying for a reverse mortgage.

{"prompt":"What information do I have to provide a lender in order to receive a Loan Estimate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Since October 3, 2015, loan officers are required to provide you with a Loan Estimate once you have provided certain information. Loan officers are required to provide you with a Loan Estimate once you have provided: your name, your income, your Social Security number (so the lender can pull a credit report), the property address, an estimate of the value of the property, and; the desired loan amount. Your loan officer cannot require you to provide documents verifying this information before providing you with a Loan Estimate. You can choose to give more information. The more information you can provide the loan officer about your financial situation, such as debts and nonwage income sources, the more accurate the information on your Loan Estimate is likely to be. Your Loan Estimate will also be more useful for you if you tell the loan officer what kind of loan you are interested in. You may want to let your loan officer know whether you are interested in: A fixed or adjustable interest rate; A specific down payment amount; A specific loan type (conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, etc.); A specific type of mortgage insurance premium (monthly, upfront, or a combination of both); Paying points upfront to lower your interest rate; Receiving lender credits to be used toward closing costs in exchange for a higher interest rate; Paying your homeowner's insurance and\/or property taxes as a part of your monthly mortgage payment rather than paying these separately yourself; Having your lender lock your interest rate, and for what timeframe; See a sample Loan Estimate form with interactive tips and definitions. Tip: Before requesting a Loan Estimate, learn more about mortgage loan options and talk to several lenders to understand the choices available to you. When you receive a Loan Estimate, the lender has not yet approved or denied your loan application.

{"prompt":"What is a prepayment penalty?\nX0X\n","completion":"   A prepayment penalty is a fee that some lenders charge if you pay off all or part of your mortgage early. If you have a prepayment penalty, you would have agreed to this when you closed on your home. Not all mortgages have a prepayment penalty. Typically, a prepayment penalty only applies if you pay off the entire mortgage balance - for example, because you sold your home or are refinancing your mortgage - within a specific number of years (usually three or five years). In some cases, a prepayment penalty could apply if you pay off a large amount of your mortgage all at once. Prepayment penalties do not normally apply if you pay extra principal on your mortgage in small chunks at a time - but it's always a good idea to double check with the lender. TIP: If a loan you are considering has a prepayment penalty, make sure to read the fine print carefully. Make sure you understand exactly the circumstances under which you will have to pay, and how much. Ask your lender for a quote for a similar loan without a prepayment penalty so you can compare total costs and make an informed decision. If you have a problem with your mortgage, you can submit a complaint to the CFPB online or by calling. If you're behind on your mortgage, or having a hard time making payments, you can use the CFPB's \"Find a Counselor\" tool to get a list of housing counseling agencies in your area that are approved by HUD.

{"prompt":"What is mortgage insurance and how does it work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Mortgage insurance lowers the risk to the lender of making a loan to you, so you can qualify for a loan that you might not otherwise be able to get.  Typically, borrowers making a down payment of less than 20 percent of the purchase price of the home will need to pay for mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance also is typically required on FHA and USDA loans. Mortgage insurance lowers the risk to the lender of making a loan to you, so you can qualify for a loan that you might not otherwise be able to get. But, it increases the cost of your loan. If you are required to pay mortgage insurance, it will be included in your total monthly payment that you make to your lender, your costs at closing, or both. About mortgage insurance Mortgage insurance, no matter what kind, protects the lender - not you - in the event that you fall behind on your payments. If you fall behind, your credit score may suffer and you can lose your home through foreclosure. There are several different kinds of loans available to borrowers with low down payments. Depending on what kind of loan you get, you'll pay for mortgage insurance in different ways: Loan types and mortgage insurance If you get aConventional loan, your lender may arrange for mortgage insurance with a private company. Private mortgage insurance(PMI) rates vary by down payment amount and credit score but are generally cheaper than FHA rates for borrowers with good credit. Most private mortgage insurance is paid monthly, with little or no initial payment required at closing. Under certain circumstances, you can cancel your PMI. If you get a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, your mortgage insurance premiums are paid to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).FHA mortgage insurance is required for all FHA loans. It costs the same no matter your credit score, with only a slight increase in price for down payments less than five percent. FHA mortgage insurance includes both an upfront cost, paid as part of your closing costs, and a monthly cost, included in your monthly payment. If you don't have enough cash on hand to pay the upfront fee, you are allowed to roll the fee into your mortgage instead of paying it out of pocket. If you do this, your loan amount and the overall cost of your loan will increase. If you get a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan, the program is similar to the Federal Housing Administration, but typically cheaper. You'll pay for the insurance both at closing and as part of your monthly payment.###"}
{"prompt":"What is mortgage insurance and how does it work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Mortgage insurance lowers the risk to the lender of making a loan to you, so you can qualify for a loan that you might not otherwise be able to get.  If you get a Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA)-backed loan, the VA guarantee replaces mortgage insurance, and functions similarly. With VA-backed loans, which are loans intended to help servicemembers, veterans, and their families, there is no monthly mortgage insurance premium. However, you will pay an upfront \"funding fee\". The amount of that fee varies based on: Your type of military service; Your down payment amount; Your disability status; Whether you're buying a home or refinancing; Whether this is your first VA loan, or you've had a VA loan before; Like with FHA and USDA loans, you can roll the upfront fee into your mortgage instead of paying it out of pocket, but doing so increases both your loan amount and your overall costs.###"}
{"prompt":"With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), what are rate caps and how do they work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) typically include several kinds of caps that control how your interest rate can adjust. There are three kinds of caps: Initial adjustment cap. This cap says how much the interest rate can increase the first time it adjusts after the fixed-rate period expires. It's common for this cap to be either two or five percent - meaning that at the first rate change, the new rate can't be more than two (or five) percentage points higher than the initial rate during the fixed-rate period. Subsequent adjustment cap. This cap says how much the interest rate can increase in the adjustment periods that follow. This cap is most commonly two percent, meaning that the new rate can't be more than two percentage points higher than the previous rate. Lifetime adjustment cap. This cap says how much the interest rate can increase in total, over the life of the loan. This cap is most commonly five percent, meaning that the rate can never be five percentage points higher than the initial rate. However, some lenders may have a higher cap. Tip: Compare rate caps when comparing ARMs. Two different lenders may have the same initial interest rate but offer different rate caps. Even if you think you'll move or refinance before the adjustable period starts, it's a good idea to know how much your rate can change. Ask the lender to calculate the highest payment you may ever have to pay on the loan you are considering. You can also find this information on your Truth-in-Lending disclosure, which lenders are required to provide you within three business days after you apply for a loan. If you're behind on your mortgage, or having a hard time making payments, you can call the CFPB to be connected to a HUD-approved housing counselor today. You can also use the CFPB's \"Find a Counselor\" tool to get a list of U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved counseling agencies in your area.

{"prompt":"For an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), what are the index and margin, and how do they work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  For an adjustable-rate mortgage, the index is a benchmark interest rate that reflects general market conditions and the margin is a number set by your lender when you apply for your loan. The index and margin are added together to become your interest rate when your initial rate expires. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the rate stays the same, generally for the first year or few years, and then it begins to adjust periodically. Once the rate begins to adjust, the changes to your interest rate are based on the market, not your personal financial situation. To calculate your new interest rate when it's time for it to adjust, lenders use two numbers: the index and the margin. Index + Margin = Your Interest Rate The index is a benchmark interest rate that reflects general market conditions. The index changes based on the market. Changes in the index, along with your loan's margin, determine the changes to the interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage loan. The lender decides which index your loan will use when you apply for the loan, and this choice generally won't change after closing. The margin is the number of percentage points added to the index by the mortgage lender to set your interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) after the initial rate period ends. The margin is set in your loan agreement and won't change after closing. The margin amount depends on the particular lender and loan. The fully indexed rate is equal to the margin plus the index.###"}
{"prompt":"If I am considering an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), what should I look out for in the fine print?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you are considering an ARM, make sure to read the terms carefully and ask lots of questions until you understand exactly how each of these features of the mortgage works.  Adjustable rate mortgages can be very complicated. There are many parts to an adjustable rate mortgage that can affect how much the mortgage will cost you. Here are key questions to ask your lender about your loan Most adjustable-rate mortgages have fixed interest rates for an initial period - for example, 3 or 5 years - and are typically re-calculated once per year after that. But this structure is not required. Some loans don't have an initial fixed-rate period, and they can adjust more or less frequently. Make sure you understand exactly how often the rate on your loan will re-adjust. The index and margin control what your interest rate will be at each adjustment for an adjustable-rate mortgage. Learn more about indexes and margins and how they work. The rate caps control the maximum amount your interest rate can change at each adjustment, and in total, over the life of the loan. Learn more about rate caps and how they work. For most loans, the payment is recalculated each time the interest rate adjusts. However, some loans may recalculate the payment amount less frequently. If your interest rate has increased but your payment has not, your loan balance could increase. Sometimes the balance of a loan can actually increase rather than decrease even though you are making payments on the mortgage. For example, your loan balance might increase if your monthly payment is not enough to cover the interest on your loan. Check to see whether the balance on your loan is allowed to increase after closing. These types of loans are called negative amortization loans. Learn more about negative amortization loans Some loans have a \"floor rate,\" or a minimum rate. Even if the index goes lower, the rate on these loans does not adjust below the floor rate. Loans can also have a clause that says that the interest rate can only ever adjust up, not down. Both of these features can make the loan more expensive and risky for you, by increasing the chance that your payments will go up in the future. If you are considering a loan with either of these features, ask the lender what benefit you would get for accepting these terms. Ask for a quote for a similar loan without these features, so you can make an informed decision. Check to see if there is a fee for paying your loan back early. Most loans do not have prepayment penalties, but it's a good idea to double-check. Learn more about prepayment penalties. If you have a problem with your mortgage, you can submit a complaint to the CFPB online or by calling.###"}
{"prompt":"Are condo\/co-op fees or homeowners' association dues included in my monthly mortgage payment?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Usually not. Condo\/co-op fees or homeowners' association dues are usually paid directly to the homeowners' association (HOA) and are not included in the payment you make to your mortgage servicer. Condominiums, co-ops, and some neighborhoods may require you to join the local homeowners' association and pay dues (HOA dues). Tip: Homeowners' association dues can range from a few hundred dollars a month to more than one thousand dollars a month. Be sure to factor in this cost when deciding if you can afford the mortgage to purchase a home or refinance. Although not common, your mortgage servicer may be willing to include your HOA dues in the escrow portion of your monthly mortgage payment upon request.###"}
{"prompt":"On a mortgage, what's the difference between my principal and interest payment and my total monthly payment?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The difference between your principal and interest payment and your total monthly payment is that your total monthly payment usually includes additional costs like homeowners insurance, taxes, and possibly mortgage insurance.  The principal and interest payment on a mortgage is probably the main component of your monthly mortgage payment. The principal is the amount you borrowed and have to pay back, and interest is what the lender charges for lending you the money. For most borrowers, the total monthly payment you send to your mortgage company includes other things, such as homeowners insurance and taxes that may be held in an escrow account. If you have an escrow account, you pay a set amount with every mortgage payment for these expenses. Your mortgage company typically holds the money in the escrow account until those insurance and tax bills are due, and then pays them on your behalf. If your loan requires other types of insurance like private mortgage insurance, these premiums may also be included in your total mortgage payment as well. Here's how it works: Principal + interest + mortgage insurance (if applicable) + escrow (homeowners insurance and tax) = total monthly payment If you live in a condo, co-op, or a neighborhood with a homeowners' association, you will likely have additional fees that are usually paid separately. Tip:Even with a fixed-rate mortgage, your total monthly payment can still change. Although your principal and interest payment will generally remain the same as long as you make regular payments on time (unless, for example, you have a balloon loan), your escrow payment can change. For example, if your home increases in value, your property taxes typically increase as well. When considering a mortgage offer, make sure to look at the total monthly payment listed on the written estimates you receive. Many homebuyers make the mistake of looking at just the principal and interest payment, leading to an unpleasant surprise when they learn their total monthly payment is much higher. You can find your estimated total monthly payment on page 1 of the Loan Estimate, in the \"Projected Payments\" section. Many lenders require you to pay your taxes and insurance in advance using an escrow account, but not all do. If there's no escrow payment listed on your Loan Estimate, these costs won't be included in your monthly payment to your mortgage lender. Instead, you'll have to pay property taxes directly to your state or local government and homeowners insurance directly to your insurance company. To make sure you can afford the mortgage, find out what your property tax and homeowners insurance bills will be, and calculate the total monthly payment yourself.###"}
{"prompt":"On a mortgage, what's the difference between my principal and interest payment and my total monthly payment?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The difference between your principal and interest payment and your total monthly payment is that your total monthly payment usually includes additional costs like homeowners insurance, taxes, and possibly mortgage insurance.  If one lender requires you to pay taxes and insurance into an escrow account, but another doesn't, compare the offers by looking at the principal and interest payment instead of the total monthly payment. Make sure to calculate the total monthly payment as well so you can be certain you can afford it.###"}
{"prompt":"What are late fees on a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Most mortgage contracts include a grace period, after which time the loan servicer charges a late fee. Late fees can be charged only in the amount specifically authorized by the mortgage documents you signed. State law may also limit the amount of late fees that you can be charged. Tip: Paying on time avoids a late fee and protects your credit record. Be sure to review your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure to understand your mortgage payments, interest, and fees. For a loan you've applied for, check page 3 of the Loan Estimate to find out how much the late fees will be. For a loan you're currently paying back, check page 4 of the Closing Disclosure. You won't receive a Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate. Instead of a Closing Disclosure, you will receive a final Truth in Lending disclosure and a HUD -1 Settlement Statement. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure. If you have a problem with your mortgage company, you should discuss the issue with your lender. You can also submit a complaint to the CFPB online or by calling. We'll forward your complaint to the company and work to get you a response - generally in 15 days.###"}
{"prompt":"Am I allowed to negotiate the terms and costs of my mortgage at closing?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. You can always negotiate the terms of the mortgage loan up until you sign on the dotted line. However, your lender or the seller can refuse to agree to any changes. It's usually easier to negotiate the fees charged by your lender than it is to negotiate third-party fees. You should always ask questions about fees and rates throughout the whole process. You can ask the settlement officer, lender or closing attorney. Ask about anything that you don't understand. This is particularly the case with fees and rates. You should know why you are paying everything you are paying. Make sure you take a list with phone numbers of all of the people involved with your closing (settlement officer, loan officer, closing attorney, real estate agent) in case you have any questions at any time during the closing process. Here are some tips to think about to help review lender fees: Ask for a justification for each lender-charged fee. If the lender charges an underwriting fee as well as a processing fee, ask for details of those services. You may find a fee that can be waived or reduced. Recognize that some items can't be negotiated. The following items are imposed by governmental authorities:TaxesCity and county stampsRecording fees; Taxes; City and county stamps; Recording fees; Other items are paid to third parties, and may be more difficult to negotiate. These are fees the lender has paid for, usually at a set price. Appraisal fee; Credit report fee; Tax service fees; Flood certification fees; Your lender may also require that you make payments into the escrow account to build up a reserve and cover future payments of taxes and insurance. Tip: The best way to get a good deal on a mortgage that's right for you is to shop around well before you get to the closing table. Learn more about how to shop for a mortgage. If you have a problem with your mortgage closing process, you should discuss the problem with your lender. You can also submit a complaint to the CFPB online or by calling. We'll forward your complaint to the lender and work to get you a response, generally in 15 days.###"}
{"prompt":"I'm about to close on a mortgage. What are the key steps I can expect in the mortgage closing process?\nX0X\n","completion":"  During this time, you sign legally binding documents in which you agree to pay back a loan and grant the lender the right to take back the house if you do not make the payments you agreed to.  The closing is a key final step in the purchasing and financing of a home. Your lender transfers money that you are borrowing to the seller on your behalf, and the seller signs a document called a \"deed,\" which is the legal document making you the owner of the home. The title company - or escrow company (in most western states) or closing attorney (in some eastern states) - prepares additional documents that support the transfer of the home to you and then records these documents with the county registrar's office or county register of deeds. You may also have to sign additional documents that identify your rights and obligations as the home loan borrower. Tip: At least three business days before closing, you receive your Closing Disclosure, which lays out the terms of the loan including an itemized list of fees associated with the closing. Take this time to review the Closing Disclosure, compare it to your Loan Estimate and make sure the loan terms are what you agreed to. Let your lender know if you believe there are mistakes and ask about anything you don't understand. Here's what you can expect: 1. You will receive a lot of documentsExpect receive and\/or sign many documents. These documents will include: Your Closing Disclosure; Your promissory note, which is your promise to repay the mortgage loan to your lender; The mortgage, also known as the security instrument ordeed of trust. By signing this document, you agree that the lender may foreclose on your home if you fail to repay your mortgage; The deed, which transfers legal ownership of the property to you; See an interactive sample Closing Disclosure and get our guide to other closing forms. Note: For some of the documents you sign, your signature needs to be notarized (for example, on the deed of trust). 2. Transfer of funds Money may also change hands. The closing or settlement agent (known as the escrow agent in western states) is responsible for collecting the money from the parties and paying it back out again according to the terms of the sale and loan. You'll need to pay for your down payment (less any deposit you've already made) as well as costs associated with the closing. Sometimes the seller may pay costs related to closing to the lender. This is determined by the terms of your purchase contract. The lender provides the funds from the mortgage loan. The closing agent then pays out the price of the home to the seller and distributes the closing costs to the various closing service providers.###"}

Taxes and insurance You will need to show proof of homeowners insurance so that the lender will fund the mortgage loan. If your loan includes an escrow account, the account is set up and you make an initial deposit. 4. Transfer of OwnershipOnce all of the documents have been signed, funds have been disbursed and the closing has been finalized, the transfer of ownership occurs. The seller, or a representative of the seller, gives you the keys to the new home, and the closing company, title company, escrow company, or attorney submits the mortgage and transfer of ownership documents to the county registrar's office to be officially recorded. Get the CFPB's closing checklist to make sure you are prepared for your closing. Note: You won't receive a Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure if you applied for a mortgage prior to Oct. 3, 2015, or if you're applying for areverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - aGood Faith Estimate (GFE)and an initialTruth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate. Instead of a Closing Disclosure, you will receive afinal Truth-in-Lending disclosureand a HUD-1 Settlement Statement If you have a problem with your mortgage closing process, you should discuss the problem with your lender.

{"prompt":"Who should I expect to see at my mortgage closing?\nX0X\n","completion":"   If you're buying a home, you should expect to see the following people at closing: You and any other co-borrowers; The seller of the property or their agent; Your real estate agent and the seller's real estate agent. Real estate agents are not required to be at the closing, but may choose to attend to make sure that the closing transaction goes through. Escrow officer. In some states, an escrow officer handles any funds that need to be exchanged during the closing. In other states, the closing agent performs this function, in addition to his or her other duties. Closing agent or settlement agent. The settlement agent is responsible for the legal transfer of title and ownership of the property from the seller to you, the buyer. In some states, there must be an attorney, who will be responsible for legal transfer of title and the exchange of funds. Other states may require an attorney to transfer the title. Check with the company that is handling your closing before going to the closing. If you're refinancing or taking on a second mortgage, there are fewer people involved in the closing: Yourself and any other co-borrowers; A representative from your lender; Your title insurance company; An attorney; Tip: If you need help finding an attorney, your county bar association may offer a referral list, or you can find lawyer referrals in your county and state by visiting the American Bar Association website. Familiarize yourself with these key people. Make sure to get their contact information ahead of the closing so you know exactly who you are dealing with and can ask questions. You should take a list with all of these people's phone numbers with you to closing.###"}
{"prompt":"What fees or charges are paid when closing on a mortgage and who pays them?\nX0X\n","completion":"  When you are buying a home you generally pay all of the costs associated with that transaction. However, depending on the contract or state law, the seller may end up paying for some of these costs. Even if you don't pay the mortgage closing fees directly out of pocket, you might end up paying them indirectly. Sometimes, you can negotiate with the seller for a \"credit\" towards your closing costs, but the seller will usually require you to pay a higher price for the home in order to cover the costs of this credit. You're still paying for these costs - they are just paid through your loan instead of paid out of pocket. The lender may also offer to give you a credit to help with your closing costs. This credit isn't free either. Typically, the lender will either increase your loan amount to cover these costs, or charge you a higher interest rate in exchange for the credit. Common closing fees or charges may include: Appraisal fees; Tax service provider fees; Title insurance; Government taxes; Prepaid expenses such as property taxes, homeowners insurance, and interest until your first payment is due; Tip: You can get a detailed explanation of all the fees, charges or other costs associated with your loan by checking our\"Your Home Loan Toolkit\".###"}
{"prompt":"Do auto and homeowners insurance companies share my information about claims and policies?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. There arespecialty consumer reporting agenciesthat collect information about the insurance claims you have made on your property and casualty insurance policies, such as your homeowners and auto policies. They may also collect driving records. Insurance companies use information in these reports to choose the types of policies they offer you and the premiums you pay. Just like with the big three consumer reporting agencies - Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion - you can get free copies of your reports every 12 months from many of the specialty consumer reporting agencies. Other specialty consumer reporting agencies may be able to charge you a fee for your report. Keep in mind that not every agency will have information on everyone. You have to request the reports individually from each reporting agency. We've put together a list of some of these specialty consumer reporting agencies, along with some information about how you can obtain copies of your reports. A consumer reporting agency, including a specialty agency, must also give you a free copy of your consumer report upon request if you have received an \"adverse action\" notice. Example: Let's say an insurance company turns you down for a homeowners insurance policy based on a consumer report. This is an example of an \"adverse action\". The insurance company must provide you with an \"adverse action\" notice that includes the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency from which the insurance company got the consumer report. Tip: You have the right to get a free report from the consumer reporting agency identified in an \"adverse action\" notice. Review the report to see what information the consumer reporting agency has on file about your insurance history. You can then ask for corrections of any errors in the report. Tip: Check your reports before you shop or if you have been denied coverage or offered coverage with higher premiums in the past. You should check your reports to make sure they do not contain mistakes. If they do, you can ask for corrections of any errors in the report.###"}
{"prompt":"What is a \"higher-priced mortgage loan\"?\nX0X\n","completion":"  In general, a higher-priced mortgage loan has an annual percentage rate (APR) that's higher than a specified amount over a benchmark rate called the Average Prime Offer Rate. The Average Prime Offer Rate (APOR) is an annual percentage rate that is based on average interest rates, fees, and other terms on mortgages offered to highly qualified borrowers. Your mortgage will be considered a higher-priced mortgage loan (HPML) if the APR is a certain percentage higher than the APOR, depending on what type of loan you have: First-lien mortgages: If your mortgage is a first-lien mortgage, the lender of this mortgage will be the first to be paid if you go into foreclosure. In general, a first-lien mortgage is \"higher-priced\" if the APR is 1.5 percentage points or more than the APOR. Jumbo loans: If your mortgage is a first-lien \"jumbo\" loan, it is generally \"higher-priced\" if the APR is 2.5 percentage points or more higher than the APOR. Subordinate-lien mortgages: If your mortgage is a subordinate-lien mortgage, sometimes called a second-lien mortgage or junior-lien mortgage, and you go into foreclosure, the lender of this mortgage will be paid only after your first-lien mortgage is paid off. A subordinate-lien mortgage is generally \"higher-priced\" if the APR of this mortgage is 3.5 percentage points or more higher than the APOR. Example: Let's say you're looking for a mortgage loan that's not a jumbo loan for a new home. You decide on a mortgage loan from Lender X with a 6.5 percent APR. Lender X checks this week's APOR and finds that it is at 5 percent. Since this mortgage will be the primary, or first-lien, mortgage on your house, and because your APR will be 1.5 percentage points higher than the APOR, your mortgage will be considered a higher-priced mortgage loan. Why does it matter if I have a higher-priced mortgage loan? A higher-priced mortgage loan is more expensive than a mortgage with average terms. Therefore, additional protections apply to your loan. Your lender may have to: Obtain a full interior appraisal from a licensed or certified appraiser; Provide a second appraisal of your home for free, if it is a \"flipped\" home; In many instances, maintain an escrow account for at least five years;###"}
{"prompt":"What is a debt-to-income ratio?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is all your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income. This number is one way lenders measure your ability to manage the monthly payments to repay the money you plan to borrow. Different loan products and lenders will have different DTI limits. To calculate your DTI, you add up all your monthly debt payments and divide them by your gross monthly income. Your gross monthly income is generally the amount of money you have earned before your taxes and other deductions are taken out. For example, if you pay $1500 a month for your mortgage and another $100 a month for an auto loan and $400 a month for the rest of your debts, your monthly debt payments are $2,000. ($1500 + $100 + $400 = $2,000.) If your gross monthly income is $6,000, then your debt-to-income ratio is 33 percent. ($2,000 is 33% of $6,000.)###"}
{"prompt":"What is a Qualified Mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A Qualified Mortgage is a category of loans that have certain, less risky features that help make it more likely that you'll be able to afford your loan.  A lender must make a good-faith effort to determine that you have the ability to repay your mortgage before you take it out. This is known as the \"ability-to-repay\" rule. If your loan is a Qualified Mortgage it means the lender met certain requirements and it's assumed that the lender followed the ability-to-repay rule. Generally, the requirements for a qualified mortgage include: Certain risky loan features are not permitted, such as:An \"interest-only\" period, when you pay only the interest without paying down the principal, which is the amount of money you borrowed\".Negative amortization,\" which can allow your loan principal to increase over time, even though you're making payments\".Balloon payments,\" which are larger-than-usual payments at the end of a loan term. The loan term is the length of time over which your loan should be paid back. Note that balloon payments are allowed under certain conditions for loans made by small lenders. Loan terms that are longer than 30 years. An \"interest-only\" period, when you pay only the interest without paying down the principal, which is the amount of money you borrowed. \"Negative amortization,\" which can allow your loan principal to increase over time, even though you're making payments. \"Balloon payments,\" which are larger-than-usual payments at the end of a loan term. The loan term is the length of time over which your loan should be paid back. Note that balloon payments are allowed under certain conditions for loans made by small lenders. Loan terms that are longer than 30 years. A limit on the price of your loan. The annual percentage rate, or APR, on a Qualified Mortgage cannot be higher than a particular threshold. This threshold can depend on the type or size of your loan. No excess upfront points and fees. If you get a Qualified Mortgage, there are limits on the amount of certain up-front points and feesyour lender can charge. These limits will depend on the size of your loan. Not all charges, like the cost of a FHA insurance premiums, for example, are included in this limit. If the points and fees exceed the threshold, then the loan can't be considered a Qualified Mortgage. Consider and verify income or assets and debts. For your loan to be a Qualified Mortgage, your lender must consider and verify your current monthly income or assets (other than the value of the property that will secure your loan) and your monthly debt. Your lender must also consider either how much of your income can go towards your monthly debt, including your mortgage and all other monthly debt payments (known as your debt-to-income ratio) or how much of your income you will have left over after paying your monthly debt (known as your residual income).###"}
{"prompt":"What types of loans are covered under the Military Lending Act?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Payday loans, overdraft lines of credit, and most installment loans are covered by the Military Lending Act. As of October 3, 2016, most types of consumer loans offered to active-duty servicemembers and their dependents have to comply with the Military Lending Act (MLA). These credit products include, but are not limited to: Payday loans, deposit advance products, and vehicle title loans; Overdraft lines of credit but not traditional overdraft services; and; Installment loans, with the exceptions noted below. NOTE:Credit card companies didn't have to comply with the MLA until October 3, 2017. If you're a servicemember on active duty and decide to take out one of these loans, you have rights under the MLA, including a limit on the interest rate the creditor can charge. There are some loans the MLA doesn't cover - namely, credit that is secured by the property being purchased. These loans include: Residential mortgages (financing to buy or build a home that is secured by the home), mortgage refinances, home equity loans or lines of credit, or reverse mortgages; A loan to buy a motor vehicle when the credit is secured by the motor vehicle you are buying; and; A loan to buy personal property when the credit is secured by the property you're buying, like a vehicle or home appliance.###"}
{"prompt":"Should I use a home equity loan to refinance my student loans at a lower interest rate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  This can be risky. Student loan borrowers who have built equity in their homes may find that paying back outstanding student debt with a new home equity loan looks appealing, but putting more debt on your home can lead to problems down the road. Before you take out a home equity loan to pay off a student loan, you should try to look for a student loan refinance product first and see what rate you can get. You may be able to lower your interest rate without some of the risks that come with a decision to tap the equity in your home. Here are a few things to remember: Your rate may be lower, but your home is at risk. Interest rates for home equity loans are generally lower than interest rates for student loans. Lenders are willing to offer a lower interest rate because they know that if you don't pay, they have a legal claim on your home. If you can't pay, you could end up in foreclosure. On your federal loans, you are giving up repayment options and forgiveness benefits. Federal student loans feature a number of protections for borrowers that run into trouble, including Income-Driven Repayment. These benefits no longer exist when you pay off a federal student loan with a home equity loan. This may impact your taxes. You may wish to consult with a tax advisor when considering your options. For student borrowers with plenty of savings for a rainy day, a steady income, and a solid understanding of the tax benefits, a home equity loan may offer an opportunity to pay off your student loans at a lower interest rate. But again, there is always a risk of losing your home if you don't make your payments.###"}

Shared information includes: When you apply for an account; When an account is opened; The amount loaned or the credit limit; The account balance; The status of your payments; If your account is in collection; Credit reporting companies also purchase public records like liens, bankruptcy filings, and court judgments from public records providers.###"}
{"prompt":"Can my partner, family, or dependents live in my home if I have a reverse mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  As long as you still live in the home, having a reverse mortgage does not change who can live with you.  Most reverse mortgages today are Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), insures HECMs. As long as you still live in the home, having a HECM does not change who can live with you. However, if you die or move out of the home, the HECM loan becomes due- which means you, your family members, or heirs will need to pay off the loan in order to keep the home. If you are co-borrowing your HECM with a spouse (or anyone else), your co-borrower can stay in the home even if you die or move out of the home. If your spouse is not a co-borrower on the reverse mortgage, but was married to you at the time you took out the reverse mortgage, they may be able to remain in the home without paying the loan balance after you die or move into a health care facility, if they qualify under HUD's rules. From the time you get a reverse mortgage, your non-borrowing spouse must continue to live in the house as their principal primary residence\". Children, relatives, or other dependents who are not co-borrowers on the reverse mortgage, or spouses who do not qualify as an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse under HUD's rules will have to pay off the HECM loan balance in order to remain in the home. Most borrowers or their heirs will need to sell their home to repay the reverse mortgage. With an FHA-insured HECM loan, if the loan balance is more than your home is worth, you or your heirs won't have to pay the excess. After you or your heirs sell the home, the lender will take the proceeds from the sale as payment on the loan, and the FHA insurance will cover any remaining loan balance. If you or your heirs would like to keep your home instead of selling it, the loan must be paid off with another source of funds. But you or your heirs won't have to pay more than the full loan balance or 95 percent of the home's appraised value, whichever is less. Get help Before you apply for any reverse mortgage loan, you and your spouse or partner should seek a HUD-approved counselor to help you decide if a reverse mortgage is right for you.

{"prompt":"What is a Truth-in-Lending Disclosure? When do I get to see it?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The federal Truth-in-Lending Act - or \"TILA\" for short - requires that borrowers receive written disclosures about important terms of creditbeforethey are legally bound to pay the loan. These important terms include: Annual Percentage Rate: the APR is the cost of credit expressed as a yearly rate in a percentage; Finance Charge: cost of credit expressed as a dollar amount (this is the total amount of interest and certain fees you will pay over the life of the loan if you make every payment when due); Amount Financed: the dollar amount of credit provided to you (this is normally the amount you are borrowing); Total of Payments: the sum of all the payments that you will have made at the end of the loan (this includes repayment of the principal amount of the loan plus all of the finance charges); The TILA disclosures will also include other important terms such as the number of payments, the monthly payment, late fees, whether you can prepay your loan without a penalty, and other important terms. Note that the TILA disclosure is often provided as part of the loan contract, so you may be given the entire contract for review when you ask for the TILA disclosure. You should review it all, paying special attention to the disclosures noted above. You should always insist on receiving and reviewing your TILA disclosure before you sign your loan contract.###"}
{"prompt":"I heard about the new Federal Housing Authority refinancing option with reduced fees. Can you tell me more about it?\nX0X\n","completion":"  On March 6, 2012, the President and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced price cuts to FHA's Streamline Refinance Program. The cuts will be available beginning June 11, 2012. To qualify, you must be current on your existing FHA-insured mortgage, and the mortgage must have been endorsed on or before May 31, 2009. The FHA estimates the average FHA-insured borrower could save approximately $3,000 per year or $250 per month by refinancing through this streamlined process. The FHA Streamline Refinance does not require additional underwriting. FHA-insured homeowners should contact their existing lender to determine their eligibility.###"}
{"prompt":"If I want to rely on the alimony or child support that I receive in my mortgage or home equity loan application, does a lender or broker have to consider that income?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes, if the payments are likely to be consistently made. A creditor such as a lender or broker can consider the amount of such income and likelihood that it will continue, as with all other forms of income. In determining this, a lender or broker may consider factors such as whether there is a written agreement or court decree, how long and how regularly you have been receiving payments, and the creditworthiness of the payor when that information is available.###"}
{"prompt":"Can a lender or broker ask me about the alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments that I receive?\nX0X\n","completion":"  In general, only if you want the creditor to consider such payments as part of your application for credit. A lender or broker may ask whether income stated in your application comes from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. However, the lender or broker must tell you that you do not have to reveal such income if you do not want it considered.###"}
{"prompt":"If I lose my home to foreclosure, can I ever buy a home again? What impact will a foreclosure have on my credit report?\nX0X\n","completion":"  It is possible to qualify for a mortgage after a foreclosure. However, foreclosure will hurt your credit. Foreclosure information generally remains in your credit report for seven years from the date of the foreclosure. Even if you have a bad credit history or a low credit score, you may qualify for an Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan. You may also qualify for a subprime mortgage, but note that subprime mortgages may have much higher interest rates than most other mortgages. Carefully consider the costs and risks of the loan that you are offered, and weigh the costs of the loan you might be able to get now against the option to wait and build up your credit history before buying a home. Tip: Use our checklist for more information on how to avoid foreclosure.###"}
{"prompt":"When will my lender run or obtain a copy of my credit report?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Your lender will run your credit report when you apply for a mortgage. (It cannot pull your credit report if you just call to ask about rates.) It will also pull your score again just before you close on a loan. TIP: Be careful how you use credit between the time you apply for a mortgage and your loan closing. Opening a lot of new credit cards or maxing out existing cards, for example, can lower and damage your credit score significantly. This may affect the rate you can get on a mortgage.###"}
{"prompt":"Will a lender getting a copy of my credit report affect my score?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A single credit inquiry from a lender will have little impact on your credit score. Credit scoring models also take into account when a consumer is shopping for the best rate on a student loan, auto loan, or mortgage and do not penalize them for this comparison shopping. For these types of loans, scoring models generally count multiple inquiries as one inquiry if they occur within a reasonably short period of time. In general, credit inquiries for the same type of loan made within a 14-day period will be treated as no more than a single inquiry. For the most common credit scoring models, student loan, auto loan and mortgage-related inquiries that occur 30 days prior to scoring have no effect at all on your credit score. Outside this 30-day period, student loan, auto loan and mortgage-related inquiries that occur within any 45-day period are treated as a single inquiry.###"}
{"prompt":"How does my credit score affect my ability to get a mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Your credit score, as well as the information on your credit report, are key ingredients in determining whether you'll be able to get a mortgage, and the rate you'll pay. Your credit report and your credit score are two different things. Your credit score is calculated based on the information in your credit report. Higher scores reflect a better credit history and make you eligible for lower interest rates. You have many different credit scores, and there are many ways to get a credit score. However, most mortgage lenders use FICO scores. Your score can differ depending on which credit reporting agency is used. Most mortgage lenders look at scores from all three major credit reporting agencies - Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion - and use the middle score for deciding what rate to offer you. Errors on your credit report can reduce your score artificially - which could mean a higher interest rate and less money in your pocket - so it is important to check your credit report and correct any errors well before you apply for a loan. Your credit score is only one component of your mortgage lender's decision, but it's an important one. Other factors include: Credit report; Credit history with that lender; The amount of debt you already have; How much you have in savings; Your total assets; Current income; Tip: Don't apply for a lot of new credit in a short time, especially if you are getting ready to get a mortgage. Doing so may negatively affect your score. Your credit score may decline if you have too many credit accounts. It can also go down if you apply for or open many new accounts in a short time. However, when you request your own credit report, or when your existing creditors check your credit report, those requests to see your credit report should not hurt your score.###"}
{"prompt":"My spouse and I are both servicemembers or veterans and are eligible for VA home loans. Can we use one of our loans to purchase a vacation home or a rental investment property?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No, you can't. VA loans are only for a primary residence. If two servicemembers each have a certificate of eligibility, a home you buy together still has to be one that you will use as your primary residence. That means that you cannot use your VA Home Loan benefit to buy a second home for investment purposes or for use as a vacation home. If you already have a VA loan for a property used as your primary residence, it may be possible to use that home as a rental property and use your remaining eligibility to purchase another home for use as your primary residence. Before trying to use this option, though, it's very important to consult your Regional VA Office for details and confirmation regarding your remaining eligibility.###"}
{"prompt":"I am a servicemember or veteran. Will I be able to get a conventional or VA mortgage on a manufactured home?\nX0X\n","completion":"  VA-guaranteed home loans are available for manufactured homes, though maximum loan amounts vary. Please access the VA's website or call 1-877-827-3702 for further assistance. Manufactured homes are also eligible for government-insured loans offered by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Rural Housing Service (RHS) under the U. S. Department of Agriculture. As with conventional mortgages, there are many factors involved in determining the loan amount you will qualify for under these programs. These factors include: State laws; Whether the home is attached to the land; Whether you are also purchasing the land; Neighborhood covenants; Make sure you consult more than one lender. Don't take the deal offered by the company selling the home without careful comparison. Also, keep in mind that manufactured home values have been known to drop faster than those for site-built homes. If you receive Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders, it may be challenging to sell your manufactured home for enough to pay off your debt, even in a favorable real estate market. Moving the home to your new location may not be feasible or may be very expensive. If you'd like advice as you consider whether to buy a manufactured home, consult your installation's Personal Financial Management Program (PFMP) counselor, Legal Assistance Office or military housing office. You can find your nearest PFMP office online by selecting \"Personal Financial Management Services\" in the \"Program or Service\" drop-down box.###"}
{"prompt":"I am a servicemember or veteran and I have decided to purchase a home. How do I know if a VA loan is the right fit for me?\nX0X\n","completion":"  You should consider the advantages and disadvantages of getting a U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed loan. Some of the advantages, once you qualify, include the ability to buy a home with no down payment (as long as the sales price doesn't exceed the appraised value), as well as the absence of the private mortgage insurance (PMI) requirement. PMI may cost up to one percent of the loan amount each year. The VA loan program also limits the closing costs you may be charged and gives you the right to prepay your mortgage without a penalty. Also, the VA may be able to offer you some assistance if you run into temporary financial difficulties. There may be disadvantages to a VA loan. For example, a VA loan could have a higher interest rate than a conventional loan, although interest rates on VA loans are negotiable. In addition, most borrowers are required to pay a VA loan funding fee (currently between one and three percent of the amount of the loan). Also, opting for a loan without a down payment makes it important that you plan to stay in the home for a while because a drop in home values could quickly put you \"upside down\" on your mortgage, leaving you owing more than the home is worth. The larger the down payment you are able to make, the more cushion you have to prevent this from happening. For more information go to the VA's home loan program's website or contact your local legal assistance office. Do your homework! Your real estate agent, broker or lender may not always understand the unique needs of servicemembers and their families.###"}
{"prompt":"What is mortgage forbearance?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Forbearance is when your mortgage servicer or lender allows you to temporarily pay your mortgage at a lower payment or pause paying your mortgage. You will have to pay the payment reduction or the paused payments back later. Forbearance can help you deal with a hardship, such as, if your home was damaged in a flood, you had an illness or injury that increased your healthcare costs, or you lost your job. Forbearance does not erase the amount you owe on your mortgage. You will have to repay any missed or reduced payments.###"}
{"prompt":"How does foreclosure work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Foreclosure processes differ by state. They are generally done in two ways. If done by filing a lawsuit, it is called \"judicial foreclosure\". In some states, the lender can foreclose without going to court, and that is called \"non-judicial foreclosure\". State foreclosure processes require that the borrower(s) be notified regarding the foreclosure proceedings. There are also other federal rules that may apply. Foreclosure is when the lender takes back property when the homeowner fails to make payments on a mortgage. Foreclosure processes differ by state. Typically, if you fall a few months behind on your mortgage payments, the foreclosure process may begin (although the process can begin earlier or later). Don't wait for the foreclosure process to begin. Reach out for help as soon as you think you might have trouble paying your mortgage. The foreclosure process generally may proceed in one of these ways depending on your state: Judicial foreclosure. This requires that the process go through a court where the borrower can raise defenses. Non-judicial foreclosure. This is done without filing a court action and is carried out by a series of steps, including required written notices under a \"power of sale\" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust. Foreclosure processes require that the borrower(s) be notified regarding the proceedings and generally involve giving public notice. State laws on giving notice and scheduling a foreclosure sale vary. Some states may also provide you with the right to mediation prior to foreclosure. Be sure to read your mail and any legal notices carefully and act promptly on notices you receive. If you are having trouble paying your mortgage, you may have options. You can use the CFPB's \"Find a Counselor\" tool to get a list of counseling agencies in your area that are approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can also call the HOPE Hotline, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, If you're facing foreclosure or have been served with legal papers, you may also need to consult an attorney. Military members or veterans can call the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or visit the VA's home loan website to get personalized assistance. Military members may also contact their local JAG office for more information. To find your JAG Legal Assistance Office, use the locator. Tip: Use this checklist for more information on how to avoid foreclosure.###"}

{"prompt":"What fees can my lender charge if I take out a HELOC?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Before you take out a Home Equity Line of Credit be sure to read the documents carefully to see what fees your lender can charge you. Under some plans, lenders can charge you: For not using your HELOC (an inactivity fee); For each year you have the HELOC (an annual or membership fee); For terminating the HELOC early, usually within the first two or three years after it is opened (a cancellation fee);###"}
{"prompt":"If I take out a Home Equity Line of Credit\/HELOC, how much can I borrow?\nX0X\n","completion":"  When you take out a Home Equity Line of Credit, the creditor will establish a credit limit, which is the maximum amount you can borrow using the HELOC. The amount of your credit limit depends on several factors, including how much equity you have in your home.###"}
{"prompt":"My lender offered me a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). What is a HELOC?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A HELOC is a line of credit that allows you to borrow against your home equity.  Equity is the amount your property is currently worth, minus the amount of any mortgage on your property. Unlike a home equity loan, HELOCs usually have adjustable interest rates. For most HELOCs, you will receive special checks or a credit card, and you can borrow money only for a specified time, from when you open your account. This time period is known as the \"draw period\". During the \"draw period,\" you can borrow money and you must make minimum payments. When the \"draw period\" ends, you will no longer be able to borrow money from your line of credit. After the \"draw period\" ends, you may be required to pay off your balance all at once or you may be allowed to repay over a certain period of time. During this time, known as the \"repayment period,\" you will not be able to borrow additional amounts and may have to make larger minimum payments than during the draw period. Under some plans, if you make only the minimum payments you will not pay off your entire balance by the end of the term. At that point, you will have to pay the remaining balance as a single lump-sum, known as a \"balloon payment\". If you cannot get another loan to repay this amount, or pay it off using your savings, you could lose your home. HELOCs usually have a variable interest rate that changes over time, so your payments may not be the same from month to month. If the value of your home falls significantly, your lender may decide not to allow you to take out additional credit under your HELOC plan, which may result in you not having access to as much money as you thought you would. Tip: If you are considering a home equity line of credit, shop around to compare all your options. Just like other mortgages, HELOCs have costs and fees associated with them. Also be sure you review the risks of this line of credit. The best way to avoid problems is not to sign anything you don't understand. If you are having trouble with your bills, taking out a HELOC to pay down your debt may cause more trouble for you and put your home at risk. Before taking out a HELOC to consolidate your debts, talk to a U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-approved housing counselor. A HUD-approved housing counselor can, advise you on managing your money and debts, help you develop a budget, and give you free educational materials.###"}

{"prompt":"Can I use a reverse mortgage loan to buy a home?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. There is a \"Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for Purchase\" loan that allows people 62 and older to purchase a new principal residence with HECM loan proceeds. A \"HECM for Purchase\" loan requires that you be 62 years of age or older and that the home you are purchasing be your principal residence. You will need to have cash available for the down payment. There will also be closing costs, which will be higher than those with other reverse mortgage loans. Some of these closing costs may be paid by the seller (depending on your state's laws), so it is a good idea to shop around and talk to multiple lenders after speaking with your reverse mortgage housing counselor. For HECM for Purchase loans you'll need cash to pay the difference between the HECM proceeds and the sales price plus any closing costs. Like all reverse mortgage loans, you will not have to make monthly payments on the HECM for Purchase loan. You will still need to fulfill the reverse mortgage requirements, such as living in the home as your principal residence, keeping the home in good condition, and paying your property taxes and homeowners\/flood insurance premiums on time. Note: Not all properties are eligible for the HECM for Purchase loan program. For example, cooperative units and some manufactured homes are ineligible for the HECM for Purchase loan program. Your right to cancel a reverse mortgage With most reverse mortgages, you have three business days after closing to cancel the deal for any reason, without penalty. This is known as your right of \"rescission\". To cancel, you must notify the lender in writing. Send your letter by certified mail, and ask for a return receipt so that you have documentation of when you sent and when the lender received your cancellation notice. Keep copies of any communications between you and your lender. After you cancel, the lender has 20 days to return any money you've paid for the financing of the reverse mortgage loan. If you believe there is a reason to cancel the loan after the three-day period, seek legal help to see if you have the right to cancel. Note: This information only applies to Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), which are the most common type of reverse mortgage loan.###"}
{"prompt":"When do I have to pay back a reverse mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Reverse mortgage loans typically must be repaid either when you move out of the home or when you die. However, the loan may need to be paid back sooner if the home is no longer your principal residence, you fail to pay your property taxes or homeowners insurance, or do not keep the home in good repair. Most reverse mortgage loans are Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). A HECM must be paid off when the last surviving borrower or Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse: Dies; Sells their home, or; No longer lives in the home as their principal residence, meaning where they live for a majority of the year. If the you are away for more than 12 consecutive months in a healthcare facility such as a hospital, rehabilitation center, nursing home, or assisted living facility and there is no co-borrower living in the home, anyone living with you will have to move out unless they are able to pay back the loan or qualify as an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse.

{"prompt":"If I take out a reverse mortgage loan, does the lender own my home?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No. When you take out a reverse mortgage loan, the title to your home remains with you. Most reverse mortgages are Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), insures HECMs. Just like a traditional mortgage, with a HECM you are borrowing money and using your home as security for the loan. You must continue to pay for property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and make repairs needed to maintain your home or the lender can foreclose on the home. HECMs also require you to use the home as your principal residence. Note: This webpage has information about HECMs, which are the most common type of reverse mortgage. If you move out, sell your home, or the last surviving borrower or eligible non-borrowing spouse dies, you or your estate will need to repay the HECM loan, but you will never owe more than the value of the house. The loan balance will include the amount you have received in cash, plus the interest and fees that have been added to the loan balance each month. To repay the loan, you or your heirs may have to sell the house. Read more about what happens to your reverse mortgage when you die or need to move to a nursing home.###"}
{"prompt":"How much money can I get with a reverse mortgage loan, and what are my payment options?\nX0X\n","completion":"  How much you can borrow depends on your age, the interest rate you get on your loan, and the value of your home. You have three main options for receiving your money: through a line of credit, monthly payout, or lump sum payout. Your borrowing limit is called the \"principal limit\". It takes into account your age, the interest rate on your loan, and the value of your home. In general, loans with older borrowers, higher-priced homes, and lower interest rates will have higher principal limits than loans with younger borrowers, lower-priced homes, and higher interest rates. If you are married or co-borrowing with another person, the principal limit is based on the age of the youngest co-borrower, or Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse. You have three main options for receiving your money:; Lower cost than a lump sum payment because you'll only be paying interest and fees on the money you use. You can use a credit line growth feature that allows you to borrow some money now and leave some credit available for the future. Whatever you don't use in your credit line will keep growing, allowing you to borrow up to a maximum amount stated in your mortgage. Can be combined with monthly payout. Get a set monthly payout to supplement your income. Two choices: Term (fixed monthly payouts for a set number of years) or Tenure (fixed monthly payouts as long as you maintain the reverse mortgage and the payout does not cause the balance to exceed the amount stated in the mortgage). Lower cost than a lump sum payment because you'll be paying interest and fees only on the money you've drawn so far. Can be combined with a line of credit. Withdraw all available funds at once. Amount available may be lower compared to other payment options. Higher cost than a line of credit or monthly payout because you'll be paying interest and fees on entire loan amount drawn at closing. No credit line growth feature. Higher risk for younger borrowers because the borrower may outlive loan funds.

{"prompt":"Can anyone take out a reverse mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No. Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), the most common type of reverse mortgage loan, are a special type of home loan available to homeowners who are 62 and older.  Aside from age, other reverse mortgage requirements include: Your home must be your principal residence, meaning you live there the majority of the year. You must either own your home outright or have a low mortgage balance. Owning your home outright means you do not have a mortgage on it anymore. If you have a mortgage balance, you must be able to pay it off when you close on the reverse mortgage. You can use your own funds or money from the reverse mortgage to pay off your existing mortgage balance. You cannot owe any federal debt, such as federal income taxes or federal student loans. You may, however, use money from the reverse mortgage loan to pay off this debt. You must have enough of your own money or agree to set aside part of the reverse mortgage funds at your loan closing to pay ongoing property charges, including taxes and insurance, as well as maintenance and repair costs. Your home must be in good shape. If your house does not meet the required property standards, the lender will tell you what repairs need to be made before you can get a reverse mortgage loan. You must receive counseling from a HUD-approved reverse mortgage counseling agency to discuss your eligibility, the financial implications of the loan, and other alternatives. Alternatives to a reverse mortgage Before taking out a reverse mortgage, make sure you understand this type of loan. You may want to look at other borrowing and housing options such as: If you take out a reverse mortgage loan when you are too young, you may run out of money when you're older and more likely to have less income and higher health care bills. A home equity loan or a home equity line of credit might be a cheaper way to borrow cash against your equity. However, these loans carry their own risks and usually have monthly payments. Qualifying for these loans also depends on your income and credit. Depending on interest rates, refinancing your current mortgage with a new traditional mortgage could lower your monthly mortgage payments. Pay attention to the length of time you'll have to repay your new mortgage as it can affect your retirement plan. For example, taking on a new 30-year mortgage when you are nearing retirement can become a hardship later. Consider choosing a shorter-term mortgage, such as a 10- or 15-year loan. Consider selling your home. Moving to a more affordable home may be your best option to reduce your overall expenses. There are state and local programs that may help with utilities and fuel payments as well as home repairs.###"}

{"prompt":"Are there different types of reverse mortgages?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. There are several kinds of reverse mortgage loans: (1) those insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA); (2) proprietary reverse mortgage loans that are not FHA-insured; and (3) single-purpose reverse mortgage loans offered by state and local governments. Most reverse mortgage loans today are Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which is a part of the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In addition to HECM loans, some lenders may offer proprietary reverse mortgage loans, which are not insured by the federal government and are typically designed for borrowers with higher home values. Some state and local governments and non-profit organizations also offer single-purpose reverse mortgage loans. These reverse mortgage loans may be used only for the purpose specified by the lender (for example home repairs or property taxes). They may only be available in some areas and they may be only for homeowners with low to moderate income. These non-HECM reverse mortgage loans are not federally insured.

{"prompt":"What is a reverse mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), the most common type of reverse mortgage, is a special type of home loan only for homeowners who are 62 and older.  A reverse mortgage loan, like a traditional mortgage, allows homeowners to borrow money using their home as security for the loan. Also like a traditional mortgage, when you take out a reverse mortgage loan, the title to your home remains in your name. However, unlike a traditional mortgage, with a reverse mortgage loan, borrowers don't make monthly mortgage payments. The loan is repaid when the borrower no longer lives in the home. Interest and fees are added to the loan balance each month and the balance grows. With a reverse mortgage loan, homeowners are required to pay property taxes and homeowners insurance, use the property as their principal residence, and keep their house in good condition. With a reverse mortgage loan, the amount the homeowner owes to the lender goes up - not down - over time. This is because interest and fees are added to the loan balance each month. As your loan balance increases, your home equity decreases. A reverse mortgage loan is not free money. It is a loan where borrowed money + interest + fees each month = rising loan balance. The homeowners or their heirs will eventually have to pay back the loan, usually by selling the home. Watch out for scams related to reverse mortgages Beware of contractors who approach you about getting a reverse mortgage loan to pay for repairs to your homes. It may be a scam. Don't let yourself be pressured into getting a reverse mortgage loan. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not offer any reverse mortgage loans. Some mortgage ads falsely promise veterans special deals, imply VA approval, or offer a \"no-payment\" reverse mortgage loan to attract older Americans desperate to stay in their homes. You have a three-day right to cancel a reverse mortgage With most reverse mortgages, you have three business days after the loan closing to cancel the deal for any reason, without penalty. This is known as your right of \"rescission\". To cancel, you must notify the lender in writing. Send your letter by certified mail, and ask for a return receipt so that you have documentation of when you sent and when the lender received your cancellation notice. Keep copies of any communications between you and your lender. After you cancel, the lender has 20 days to return any money you've paid for the financing of the reverse mortgage loan.

{"prompt":"What happens if the company that I send my mortgage payments to changes?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The company that you send your monthly mortgage payments to is your mortgage servicer. Your servicer can change. Your mortgage servicer may transfer the mortgage servicing rights for your loan to another company to service your loan. If your mortgage servicing rights are transferred to a new servicer, you will need to start sending your monthly payments to the new servicer after a certain date. You will also need to direct any questions about your loan to the new servicer. You should be notified of the transfer before it happens Your old and new servicers generally must send you a notice telling you about the transfer of the servicing rights to your loan. Your old servicer generally should send this notice at least 15 days before your loan's servicing rights are actually transferred to the new servicer. Your new servicer generally should send a notice to you within 15 days after the servicing rights for your loan are transferred, unless it was combined with the first notice. The notice(s) should tell you: The date on which your old servicer will stop accepting payments; The date on which your new servicer will begin to accept payments; The new servicer's name and their contact information; The specific date the right to service your loan transferred to the new servicer; If you send your payments to the wrong servicer after you've been notified of the servicing transfer, your payments may not be credited properly. Here's what to do: Pay attention to the date you need to start sending your payments to the new servicer. Be sure to account for additional time if you send your mortgage payments by mail. If you authorize your bank's or credit union's online bill payment system to automatically pay your mortgage payment, you will need to tell your bank or credit union to make those payments to the new servicer. Learn more in our blog about automatic debit payments. Carefully review your monthly mortgage statement to confirm that your payments are being credited accurately. Additionally, for 60 days from the date your loan servicing transfers, your new servicer cannot charge you a late fee or treat the payment as late if you sent it to your previous servicer on time or within the applicable grace period. Issues related to servicing transfers If you're having issues with your mortgage because your servicer has changed, you may want to send both your old and new servicers an information request or a notice of error.

{"prompt":"When can I remove private mortgage insurance (PMI) from my loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Federal law provides rights to remove PMI for many mortgages under certain circumstances. Some lenders and servicers may also allow for earlier removal of PMI under their own standards.  The federal Homeowners Protection Act (HPA) provides rights to remove Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) under certain circumstances. The law generally provides two ways to remove PMI from your home loan: (1) requesting PMI cancellation or (2) automatic or final PMI termination. Request PMI cancellation You have the right to request that your servicer cancel PMI when you have reached the date when the principal balance of your mortgage is scheduled to fall to 80 percent of the original value of your home. This date should have been given to you in writing on a PMI disclosure form when you received your mortgage. If you can't find the disclosure form, contact your servicer. You can ask to cancel PMI earlier if you have made additional payments that reduce the principal balance of your mortgage to 80 percent of the original value of your home. For this purpose, \"original value\" generally means either the contract sales price or the appraised value of your home at the time you purchased it, whichever is lower (or, if you have refinanced, the appraised value at the time you refinanced). There are other important criteria you must meet if you want to cancel PMI on your loan: Your request must be in writing. You must have a good payment history and be current on your payments. Your lender may require you to certify that there are no junior liens (such as a second mortgage) on your home. Your lender can also require you to provide evidence (for example, an appraisal) that the value of your property hasn't declined below the original value of the home. If the value of your home has decreased below the original value, you may not be able to cancel PMI at this time. Automatic PMI termination Even if you don't ask your servicer to cancel PMI, your servicer still must automatically terminate PMI on the date when your principal balance is scheduled to reach 78 percent of the original value of your home. For your PMI to be cancelled on that date, you need to be current on your payments on the anticipated termination date. Otherwise, PMI will not be terminated until shortly after your payments are brought up to date. Final PMI termination There is one other way you can stop paying for PMI. If you are current on payments, your lender or servicer must end the PMI the month after you reach the midpoint of your loan's amortization schedule.###"}
{"prompt":"When can I remove private mortgage insurance (PMI) from my loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Federal law provides rights to remove PMI for many mortgages under certain circumstances. Some lenders and servicers may also allow for earlier removal of PMI under their own standards.  )The midpoint of your loan's amortization schedule is halfway through the full term of your loan. For 30-year loans, the midpoint would be after 15 years have passed. This standard for ending the PMI halfway through the loan's term is more likely to occur for people who have a mortgage with an interest-only period, principal forbearance, or a balloon payment. Keep in mind that you must be current on your monthly payments for termination to occur. Other things to keep in mind about the Homeowners Protection Act Loan investors, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, often create their own PMI cancellation guidelines that may include PMI cancellation provisions beyond what the HPA provides. But these guidelines cannot restrict the rights that the HPA provides to borrowers. For example, the HPA does not contain any requirements for a loan's tenure before a borrower may request cancellation or be eligible for automatic PMI termination (known as a \"seasoning\" requirement). Note: The rights in the Homeowners Protection Act apply to mortgages related to single-family principal residences that closed on or after July 29, 1999. If you have aFederal Housing Administration (FHA) or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan, the HPA does not apply. If you have questions about mortgage insurance on an FHA or VA loan, contact your servicer. If you have lender-paid mortgage insurance, different rules apply.###"}
{"prompt":"Do I ever have to buy property or flood insurance from my lender?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No. You may shop for property or flood insurance. But if you do not get homeowner's insurance, or let your policy lapse, your lender may insure your property and charge you for it. This is called \"force-placed\" or \"collateral protection\" insurance. It is usually much more expensive than a regular policy. A lender may also buy \"force-placed\" flood insurance for homeowners in flood zones who do not have adequate flood insurance to meet the legal minimum required to protect the property. If you can obtain your own insurance, it will generally be less expensive than the insurance bought by your lender for you. In some cases of force-placed insurance, the policy that the lender buys protects their interest but not your interest in the property. If you believe that any force-placed insurance was purchased in error, you should contact your lender immediately and give proof of your current insurance policy. Tip: If you disagree with your lender's determination that you need flood insurance, you can review the FEMA flood maps. If you think there has been an error, you can ask FEMA to issue a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), or a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F). If your loan doesn't include an escrow account, you will have to plan for potentially large property-related expenses, such as property taxes and homeowner's insurance premiums. Be sure you budget for your monthly mortgage payments plus these extra costs and stay current on your taxes and insurance payments. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may impose fines and penalties or place a tax lien on your home. In addition, if you fail to pay any of your property-related costs, your lender may add the amounts to your loan balance, add an escrow account to your loan, or require you to pay for insurance on your home that your lenders buys on your behalf, which likely would be more expensive and provide fewer benefits than what you could obtain on your own.###"}
{"prompt":"What happens if my mortgage is sold? Is my loan safe?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If your loan is sold, then your lender must provide you with a loan ownership transfer notice. Just because your loan is sold does not mean that your servicing right is sold and that you will get a new servicer. If your loan is sold, then the new owner of your loan must notify you within 30 days of the effective date of transfer. The notice will disclose the name, address, and telephone number of the new owner (and, if different, the person who can resolve issues concerning your loan payments or any right to rescind the loan), the date of transfer, and whether the transfer of ownership is recorded in public records.###"}
{"prompt":"What's the difference between a mortgage lender and a servicer?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Your mortgage lender is the financial institution that loaned you the money. Your mortgage servicer is the company that sends you your mortgage statements. Your servicer also handles the day-to-day tasks for managing your loan. Your loan servicer typically processes your loan payments, responds to borrower inquiries, keeps track of principal and interest paid, manages your escrow account (if you have one). The loan servicer may initiate foreclosure under certain circumstances. Your servicer may or may not be the same company that originally gave you your loan. Tip: To find out who your servicer is, check your monthly mortgage statement or payment coupon book. If you can't find a statement or coupon, you can try the MERS Servicer Identification System toll-free or visit the MERS website. MERS is a private company that maintains information about mortgage loans and servicers. Your loan servicer's identity may be listed in the MERS system.###"}
{"prompt":"How do I manage my monthly mortgage payment?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Your monthly mortgage statement has information that you can use to stay on top of your mortgage payment. We've created a checklist to help you manage your monthly mortgage payment. The checklist also guides you through your monthly mortgage statement. A mortgage statement usually comes on a monthly basis. Your statement contains the following information (as well as other information): Customer service contact information for your mortgage servicer; The amount due; The due date; Your interest rate; Fees and charges; Information about any past due payment, late fees, and how much you must pay to bring the account current if you are delinquent on your loan for more than 45 days; Review your statement each time it arrives. This can help you spot problems quickly. If you don't understand something on the statement, contact your mortgage servicer using the contact information on the statement. You can also send a written request for information. Consider setting up automatic paymentswith your mortgage servicer or through your bank or credit union. This can help you stay on track. What to do if you get a coupon book Not everyone receives a periodic mortgage statement. Some people may receive a coupon book. Servicers usually send out coupon books in the mail once a year. Coupon books usually have payment slips (\"coupons\") that you tear out and return with your payment. If you receive a coupon book, it might only include the servicer's contact information, your account information, and the amount due. You may need to contact the servicer to request other information, for example, an explanation of amount due or past payment information. Some servicers may not send mortgage statements or coupon books but instead may send you an email or other type of notice telling you what to pay. If you aren't sure, contact your mortgage servicer. You can also send a written request for information.###"}
{"prompt":"Is there any way I can see copies of the documents I will be signing at the closing beforehand?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. Your lender will send you a Closing Disclosure.

You can expect to receive various types of documents: Documents required by federal law These documents inform you of the key terms, provisions, and costs of your loan. They outline your key rights and responsibilities as a borrower, and record the transaction between you and your lender. These documents include: The Loan Estimate is a form that lays out important information about the loan you applied for. The lender sends you a Loan Estimate within three business days of receiving your application. Visit our interactive sample Loan Estimate with tips and definitions.

If you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage, you receive a HUD-1 Settlement Statement and a Truth-in-Lending disclosure instead of a Closing Disclosure. The Notice of the Right to Rescind for loans not used to purchase a home, for example, a refinance or home equity line of credit. This notice informs you that you have three business days from the lender's fulfillment of certain conditions to cancel your loan and provides a form for cancelling the loan. The Initial Escrow Statement, which lists the estimated taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges the lender anticipates paying from your escrow account during the first year of your loan. Contractual documentsinclude: A promissory note, which describes what you are agreeing to. It provides you with details regarding your loan, including:; The amount you owe; The interest rate of the mortgage loan; The dates when the payments are to be made; The total amount you will pay; The length of time for repayment; Whether and how the payment amounts can change; The place where the payments are to be sent; A mortgage or security instrument:This explains your responsibilities and rights as a borrower.

{"prompt":"Do I need an attorney or anyone else to represent me when closing on a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  It depends. Depending on your state's laws, you may not be required to have an attorney at the closing. However, you can choose to have an attorney review your documents beforeclosing. Technically, unless you hire an attorney to represent you at closing, no one else participating in the closing exclusively represents your interests. It's important to understand that other attorneys present at the closing - for example, the lender's or seller's attorney - do not represent you. These people may not be able to answer your questions and are required to act in the lender's or seller's interests, not yours. While some states require that there be an attorney present at closing, note that this attorney has a primary responsibility to the lender. If this is your first home purchase you may consider having your own legal representation. Your real estate agent or mortgage broker can provide recommendations if you do not have an attorney.###"}
{"prompt":"What is a mortgage \"closing\"? What happens at the closing?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The \"closing\" is the last step in buying and financing a home. The \"closing,\" also called \"settlement,\" is when you and all the other parties in a mortgage loan transaction sign the necessary documents. After signing these documents, you become responsible for the mortgage loan. Familiarize yourself with some of the key documents you will be signing so that you know what to look for when you get them. If you're purchasing a home with a loan, the closing of your loan (the time when your loan becomes final and the funds are distributed) and the closing of your home purchase (when you become owner of your new home) typically happen at the same time. Once the closing is complete, you are legally required to repay the mortgage. Your closing may include some or all of these entities: Your real estate agent or realtor; Your title insurance company; An escrow company; Your attorney (if you come from a state where attorneys conduct closings, or if you hire legal representation for your closing); The seller's attorney; Your lender may or may not attend; Depending on what state you live in, all the parties may sit around a table and sign all the documents at once. Or the closing could take several weeks as the signatures of each party are collected separately. Some companies allow you to electronically sign documents, either in advance of closing or at the closing table. A closing may even be conducted by mail or even on the internet. Regardless of who performs the closing or where it occurs, there will be many important documents that you'll need to sign that will have lasting financial implications on your life. Tip: Before you sign, make sure you carefully read and understand all the loan documents. Don't sign the loan documents if the loan is different from what you expected. Don't sign the documents if you can't make the payments, if you find any errors, or if you do not understand the loan terms. Be sure to understand how your payments may change over time. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, your payments may increase over time, and it is important to understand when the payment can change and by how much. Even with a fixed-rate mortgage, your total monthly payment may change due to changes in your taxes or insurance. Next step Learn more about the key steps in the closing process.###"}
{"prompt":"Can my final mortgage costs increase from what was on my Loan Estimate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Some mortgage costs can increase at closing, but others can't. It is illegal for lenders to deliberately underestimate the costs on your Loan Estimate. However, lenders are allowed to change some costs under certain circumstances.  Interest rate If your interest rate is not locked, it can change at any time. Even if your interest rate is locked, your interest rate can change if there are changes to your application information or if you do not close within the rate-lock timeframe. Check at the top of page 1 of yourLoan Estimateto see whether your rate is locked, and until when. Learn more about how rate locks work. Closing costs There are three categories of closing costs. Some closing costs the lender can increase by any amount, some the lender can increase by up to 10 percent, and some the lender can't increase at all. However, under certain circumstances these rules do not apply. For example, your lender is allowed to change your closing costs without restriction if: You decided to get a different kind of loan or change the amount of your down payment; The appraisal on the home you want to buy came in higher or lower than expected; You took out a new loan or missed a payment and that has changed your credit; Your lender could not document your overtime, bonus, or other income; These types of situations are called a \"change in circumstances\". Costs that can increase by any amount These costs are not controlled by the lender, and can increase by any amount at any time: Prepaid interest, property insurance premiums, or initial escrow account deposits; Fees for services required by the lender that you have shopped separately for, if you choose a service provider that is not on the lender's written list of providers; Fees for third-party services that the lender does not require; Costs that cannot increase at all If there is a \"change in circumstances,\" these costs can change by any amount, but otherwise they cannot change at all: Fees paid to the lender, mortgage broker, or an affiliate of either the lender or mortgage broker for a required service; Fees for required service that the lender did not allow you to shop separately for, when the provider is not affiliated with the lender or mortgage broker; Transfer taxes; Costs that can increase by up to 10 percent If there is a \"change in circumstances,\" these costs can change by any amount. If there is no change in circumstances, then the total of these costs cannot increase by more than 10 percent: Recording fees; Fees for required services when you have chosen a third-party service provider on the lender's written list of providers (if the provider is an affiliate of the lender, the cost cannot change at all); What happens when the costs change?.###"}
{"prompt":"Can my final mortgage costs increase from what was on my Loan Estimate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Some mortgage costs can increase at closing, but others can't. It is illegal for lenders to deliberately underestimate the costs on your Loan Estimate. However, lenders are allowed to change some costs under certain circumstances.  If the costs have increased more than the allowed limits and your application has not had a \"change in circumstances,\" you are entitled to a refund of the amount above the allowable limits.###"}
{"prompt":"What are appraisals and why do I need to look at them?\nX0X\n","completion":"  An appraisal is a written document that shows an opinion of how much a property is worth. The appraisal gives you useful information about the property. It describes what makes it valuable and may show how it compares to other properties in the neighborhood. An appraisal is an independent assessment of the value of the property. When you borrow money to buy or refinance a home, your lender may need to get a new appraisal and may require you to pay for it. Your lender may also use other ways to check the value of the home. For a typical home loan (that is, a loan secured by a first mortgage on your residential real estate), you are entitled to receive a copy of appraisals and opinions of value your lender gets. You should receive them soon after they are delivered to the lender in complete form - no later than three days before closing. You can't be charged a fee for copies of an appraisal or other valuation. But you can be charged a reasonable fee for the lender's cost of preparing the appraisal or other valuation.###"}
{"prompt":"What is owner's title insurance?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Owner's title insurance provides protection to the homeowner if someone sues and says they have a claim against the home from before the homeowner purchased it. When you purchase your home, you receive a document most often called a deed, which shows the seller transferred their legal ownership, or \"title\" to their home, to you. Title insurance can protect you if someone later sues and says they have a claim against the home from before you purchased it. Common claims come from a previous owner's failure to pay taxes or from contractors who say they were not paid for work done on the home before you purchased it. Most lenders require you to purchase a lender's title insurance policy, which protects the amount they lend. You may want to buy an owner's title insurance policy, which can help protect your financial investment in the home. You can usually shop for your title insurance provider separately from your mortgage. If you shop for title insurance, you may be able to save money. If you choose to buy owner's title insurance, the total cost will usually be lower if you use the same provider for both the lender's policy and the owner's policy, compared to buying them separately. Depending on the state where you are buying your home, your title insurance company may give you an itemized list of fees at closing, which may be different than what is shown on your Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure. This does not necessarily mean you are being charged more.###"}
{"prompt":"What is lender's title insurance?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Lender's title insurance protects your lender against problems with the title to your property-such as someone with a legal claim against the home. Lender's title insurance only protects the lender against problems with the title. To protect yourself, you may want to purchase owner's title insurance. Lender's title insurance is usually required to get a mortgage loan. Lender's title insurance protects your lender against problems with the title to your property - for example, if someone sues to say they have a claim against the home. Lender's title insurance does not protect your investment in the home (your equity). If someone sues with a claim against your home, you are the first person responsible. The lender's title insurance policy only covers claims that affect the lender's loan. To protect your equity in the event of a title problem, you may want to purchase an owner's title insurance policy.###"}
{"prompt":"What is homeowner's insurance? Why is homeowner's insurance required?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Homeowner's insurance pays for losses and damage to your property if something unexpected happens, like a fire or burglary. When you have a mortgage, your lender wants to make sure your property is protected by insurance. That's why lenders generally require proof that you have homeowner's insurance. Standard homeowner's insurance doesn't cover damage from earthquakes or floods, but it may be possible to add this coverage. Homeowner's insurance is also sometimes referred to as \"hazard insurance\". Many homeowners pay for their homeowner's insurance through an escrow account as part of their monthly mortgage payment. You make the payments to the lender, and the lender holds the part of the payment that is for insurance in an escrow account. Then, when the bill for the insurance is due, the lender pays it from the escrow account. The cost of your homeowner's insurance, as well as any similar insurance to protect the property, is listed on page one of your Loan Estimate, in the \"Projected Payments\" section. However, it's usually a good idea to do your own research about how much homeowner's insurance costs. You can shop separately for homeowner's insurance and choose the provider and plan that is right for you. If you don't have insurance, your lender is allowed to buy it for you and charge you for it - but your lender must give you advance notice. If your lender buys insurance on your home because you did not keep up your homeowner's insurance, that insurance may only cover the lender, and not you. It also may be more expensive than what you could buy on your own. Homeowner's insurance protects your property. Homeowner's insurance is not the same as mortgage insurance. Note: You won't receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate. Information about the cost of homeowner's insurance can be found in Block 11 of your Good Faith Estimate (GFE). If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.###"}
{"prompt":"What required mortgage closing services can I shop for?\nX0X\n","completion":"  To figure out which mortgage closing services you can shop for, you will need yourLoan Estimate. You can shop for all of the services listed in section C of page 2 of your Loan Estimate. See an interactive sample Loan Estimate form. The lender must provide you with a written list of closing service providers when they give you theLoan Estimate. Closing services may also be known as \"settlement services\". You may be able to use a service provider that is not on this list, as long as the lender agrees to work with that service provider. Note: You won't receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate.

{"prompt":"What costs will I have to pay as part of taking out a mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  There are several different kinds of costs you pay when taking out a mortgage. Some of these costs are directly related to the mortgage - collectively, they make up the price of borrowing money. These costs are the ones you should focus on when choosing a mortgage.  Other costs, such as property taxes, are often paid with your mortgage, but they're really costs of homeownership. You would have to pay them whether or not you had a mortgage. These costs are important in deciding how much you can afford. However, lenders don't control these costs, so you shouldn't make decisions about which lender to choose based on their estimates of these costs. You pay for a mortgage in two ways: upfront and over time. When choosing a mortgage, it's important to look at both types of costs. A mortgage with a lower monthly payment may have higher upfront costs, or a mortgage with low upfront costs may have a higher monthly payment. Monthly costs. Your monthly payment will typically contain four elements: Principal. This is the money you borrowed and have to pay back. This is part of the cost of buying your home, but not a cost of borrowing money. Interest. This is the primary cost of borrowing money, but not the only one. Mortgage insurance. This is an additional cost of borrowing money, typically required for borrowers who make a down payment of less than 20%. Property taxes and homeowners' insurance. These are costs of homeownership, not of borrowing money. They are usually bundled with your monthly payment and managed by the lender through an escrow account. In addition, you may pay for condominium or homeowner's association dues. These costs are usually paid separately from your monthly payment. Learn more about these monthly costs. Upfront costs. In addition to your down payment, you have to pay for several different kinds of costs at closing. Origination and lender charges. These costs are charged by the lender for \"originating,\" or making you the loan. They are part of the price of borrowing money. Different lenders may choose to itemize these costs to varying degrees - it's the overall total that matters. Common charges are labeled origination fees, application fees, underwriting fees, processing fees, administrative fees, etc. Points. Points are a charge you pay upfront to the lender. Points are part of the price of borrowing money and are calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. You can choose whether or not to pay points. Learn more about points. Third-party closing costs. These are charges for third-party services that are required to get a mortgage, such as appraisals and title insurance.###"}
{"prompt":"What costs will I have to pay as part of taking out a mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  There are several different kinds of costs you pay when taking out a mortgage. Some of these costs are directly related to the mortgage - collectively, they make up the price of borrowing money. These costs are the ones you should focus on when choosing a mortgage.  Taxes and government fees. These fees are charged by your local government. They are charged in connection with the real estate transaction, but are usually not a cost of borrowing money. Prepaid expenses and deposits. These expenses may be associated with your loan or with homeownership. Typically, you need to pay the interest on your loan between the time you close and the end of that month. It's also common to pay the first year's homeowner's insurance premium and make initial deposits into an escrow account to cover future homeowner's insurance and property taxes.###"}
{"prompt":"What's a lock-in or a rate lock on a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A lock-in or rate lock on a mortgage loan means that your interest rate won't change between the offer and closing, as long as you close within the specified time frame and there are no changes to your application.  Mortgage interest rates can change daily, sometimes hourly. If your interest rate is locked, your rate won't change between when you get the rate lock and closing, as long as you close within the specified time frame and there are no changes to your application. Rate locks are typically available for 30, 45, or 60 days, and sometimes longer. If your rate is not locked, it can change at any time. There can be a downside to a rate lock. It may be expensive to extend if your transaction needs more time. And, a rate lock may lock you out of a lower interest rate if rates fall after you get your loan offer. Some lenders may lock your rate as part of issuing a Loan Estimate, but some may not. Check at the top of page 1 of your Loan Estimate to see if your rate is locked, and for how long. If your rate is locked, it can still change if there are changes in your application - including your loan amount, credit score, or verified income. Here are some common reasons why your interest rate might change, even though it is locked: You decided to change the kind of loan you are requesting or the amount of your down payment. The appraisal on the home you want to buy came in higher or lower than expected. Your credit score changes, for example because you applied for or took out a new loan, or missed a payment on an existing loan or credit card. Your lender could not document your overtime, bonus, or other income. Rate lock policies vary by lender. To avoid surprises, ask: \"What does it mean if I lock my rate today\"?. ; \"What rate lock time frame does this Loan Estimate provide\"?. ; \"Is a shorter or longer rate lock available, and at what cost\"?. ; \"What if my closing is delayed and the rate lock expires\"?. ; \"If I lock my rate, are there any conditions under which my rate could still change\"?. ; \"If I lock my rate, and interest rates go down, what happens\"?. ; If you decide to get a rate lock, you should make sure your rate lock agreement is long enough to cover the time until you close on your loan.###"}
{"prompt":"What's a lock-in or a rate lock on a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A lock-in or rate lock on a mortgage loan means that your interest rate won't change between the offer and closing, as long as you close within the specified time frame and there are no changes to your application.  Tip: Your Loan Estimate will state whether or not your rate is locked but it will not provide you with information about how much it would cost to extend the rate lock, how much you are paying for the specific rate lock time frame, or whether you could pay more or less for a different time frame. You should ask about those details.###"}
{"prompt":"Is there such a thing as a no-cost or no-closing loan or refinancing?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes, some lenders or mortgage brokers may offer you a loan that is advertised as having no lender fees or no closing costs. There are two ways lenders can do this. One way is by charging you a higher interest rate to cover the cost of making the loan. The other way is by adding the closing costs to your loan amount. Both methods involve no cash to close the loan but result in a higher monthly payment.###"}
{"prompt":"What is an escrow or impound account?\nX0X\n","completion":"  An escrow account, sometimes called an impound account depending on where you live, is set up by your mortgagelenderto pay certain property-related expenses. The money that goes into the account comes from a portion of your monthly mortgage payment. An escrow account helps you pay these expenses because you send money through your lender or servicer, every month, instead of having to pay a big bill once or twice a year. Many lenders require that you pay your taxes and insurance using escrow, so they can make sure that the bill gets paid. Your mortgage servicer will manage the escrow account and pay these bills on your behalf. Sometimes, escrow accounts may also be required by law. Your property taxes and insurance premiums can change from year to year. Your escrowpayment - andwith it, your total monthly payment will change accordingly. Tip: If your loan doesn't include an escrow account, you will have to plan to pay these large expenses yourself. Be sure you budget for these extra costs and stay current on your taxes and insurance payments. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may impose fines and penalties or place a tax lien on your home. You could also face foreclosure. In addition, if you fail to pay your taxes or insurance, your lender may: Add the amounts to your loan balance; Add an escrow account to your loan; Purchase new homeowners insurance for you and bill you for it. This lender-purchased insurance, known as force-placed insurance, is typically more expensive than homeowners insurance you pay on your own. Even if your lender does not require an escrow account, consider requesting one voluntarily. An escrow account makes it easier to budget for your large property-related bills by paying small amounts with each mortgage payment. That way you don't have to scramble to pay a large property tax bill or insurance premium when it comes due.###"}
{"prompt":"What are (discount) points and lender credits and how do they work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Generally, points and lender credits let you make tradeoffs in how you pay for your mortgage and closing costs. Points, also known as discount points, lower your interest rate in exchange paying for an upfront fee. Lender credits lower your closing costsin exchange for accepting a higher interest rate.  These terms can sometimes be used to mean other things. \"Points\" is a term that mortgage lenders have used for many years. Some lenders may use the word \"points\" to refer to any upfront fee that is calculated as a percentage of your loan amount, whether or not you receive a lower interest rate. Some lenders may also offer lender credits that are unconnected to the interest rate you pay - for example, as a temporary offer, or to compensate for a problem. The information below refers to points and lender credits that are connected to your interest rate. If you're considering paying points or receiving lender credits, always ask lenders to clarify what the impact on your interest rate will be. Points Points let you make a tradeoff between your upfront costs and your monthly payment. By paying points, you pay more upfront, but you receive a lower interest rate and therefore pay less over time. Points can be a good choice for someone who knows they will keep the loan for a long time. Points are calculated in relation to the loan amount. Each point equals one percent of the loan amount. For example, one point on a $100,000 loan would be one percent of the loan amount, or $1,000. Two points would be two percent of the loan amount, or $2,000. Points don't have to be round numbers - you can pay 1.375 points ($1,375), 0.5 points ($500) or even 0.125 points ($125). The points are paid at closing and increase yourclosing costs. Paying points lowers your interest rate relative to the interest rate you could get with a zero-point loan at the same lender. A loan with one point should have a lower interest rate than a loan with zero points, assuming both loans are offered by the same lender and are the same kind of loan. For example, the loans are both fixed-rate or both adjustable-rate, and they both have the same loan term, loan type, same down payment amount, etc. The same kind of loan with the same lender with two points should have an even lower interest rate than a loan with one point. Points are listed on your Loan Estimate and on your Closing Disclosure on page 2, Section A.###"}
{"prompt":"What are (discount) points and lender credits and how do they work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Generally, points and lender credits let you make tradeoffs in how you pay for your mortgage and closing costs. Points, also known as discount points, lower your interest rate in exchange paying for an upfront fee. Lender credits lower your closing costsin exchange for accepting a higher interest rate.  The exact amount that your interest rate is reduced depends on the specific lender, the kind of loan, and the overall mortgage market. Sometimes you may receive a relatively large reduction in your interest rate for each point paid. Other times, the reduction in interest rate for each point paid may be smaller. It depends on the specific lender, the kind of loan, and market conditions. It's also important to understand that a loan with one point at one lender may or may not have a lower interest rate than the same kind of loan with zero points at a different lender. Each lender has their own pricing structure, and some lenders may be more or less expensive overall than other lenders - regardless of whether you're paying points or not. That's why it pays to shop around for your mortgage. Explore current interest rates or learn more about how to shop for a mortgage. Lender credits Lender credits work the same way as points, but in reverse. You pay a higher interest rate and the lender gives you money to offset your closing costs. When you receive lender credits, you pay less upfront, but you pay more over time with the higher interest rate. Lender credits are calculated the same way as points, and may appear on lenders' worksheets as negative points. For example, a lender credit of $1,000 on a $100,000 loan might be described as negative one point (because $1,000 is one percent of $100,000). That $1,000 will appear as a negative number as part of the Lender Credits line item on page 2, Section J of your Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure. The lender credit offsets your closing costs and lowers the amount you have to pay at closing. In exchange for the lender credit, you will pay a higher interest rate than what you would have received with the same lender, for the same kind of loan, without lender credits. The more lender credits you receive, the higher your rate will be. The exact increase in your interest rate depends on the specific lender, the kind of loan, and the overall mortgage market. Sometimes, you may receive a relatively large lender credit for each 0.125% increase in your interest rate paid.###"}

Explore current interest rates or learn more about how to shop for a mortgage. See an example The chart below shows an example of the tradeoffs you can make with points and credits. In the example, you borrow $180,000 and qualify for a 30-year fixed-rate loan at an interest rate of 5.0% with zero points. In the first column, you choose to pay points to reduce your rate. In third column, you choose to receive lender credits to reduce your closing costs. In the middle column, you do neither. Tip: If you don't know how long you'll stay in the home or when you'll want to refinance and you have enough cash for closing and savings, you might not want to pay points to reduce your interest rate, or take a higher interest rate to receive credits. If you are unsure, ask a loan officer to show you two different options (with and without points or credits) and to calculate the total costs over a few different possible timeframes. Choose the shortest amount of time, the longest amount of time, and the most likely amount of time you can see yourself keeping the loan. You can also review your options with a HUD-certified housing counselor. When comparing offers from different lenders, ask for the same amount of points or credits from each lender.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between a mortgage interest rate and an APR?\nX0X\n","completion":"  An annual percentage rate (APR) reflects the mortgage interest rate plus other charges. There are many costs associated with taking out a mortgage. These include: The interest rate; Points; Fees; Other charges; The interest rate is the cost you will pay each year to borrow the money, expressed as a percentage rate. It does not reflect fees or any other charges you may have to pay for the loan. An annual percentage rate (APR) is a broader measure of the cost of borrowing money than the interest rate. The APR reflects the interest rate, any points, mortgage broker fees, and other charges that you pay to get the loan. For that reason, your APR is usually higher than your interest rate. If you have applied for a mortgage and received a Loan Estimate from one or more lenders, you can find the interest rate on page 1 under \"Loan Terms,\" and the APR on page 3 under \"Comparisons\". Tip: Take care when comparing loan options to be sure you understand any differences between the terms being offered: Take care when comparing the APRs of adjustable-rate mortgage loans. For adjustable rate mortgage loans, the APR does not reflect the maximum interest rate of the loan. Be careful when comparing the APRs of fixed-rate loans with the APRs of adjustable-rate loans, or when comparing the APRs of different adjustable-rate loans. Be careful about comparing the APR of a closed-end loan, which includes fees, to the APR of a home equity line of credit, which doesn't. Don't look at the APR alone in determining what loan makes the most sense for your circumstances. Look at this explainerforan example of how interest rates and APRs differ for adjustable rate loans.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between a mortgage broker and a mortgage lender?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A lender is a financial institution that makes loans directly to you. A broker does not lend money. A broker finds a lender. A broker may work with many lenders. Whether you use a broker or a lender, you should always shop around for the best loan terms and the lowest interest rates and fees.###"}
{"prompt":"Where can I get a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  You can get a mortgage from a wide variety of lenders, including commercial banks, thrift institutions, mortgage loan companies, and credit unions. You can also find a mortgage loan through a broker, who does not lend you the money but instead finds a lender for you. Different lenders and brokers offer or arrange different types of loans. They generally are not required to offer you the best deal available. Always shop around to find the best loan for you. Tip: Learn howmortgage rules may help you when you shop for a mortgage.###"}
{"prompt":"What's the difference between a prequalification letter and a preapproval letter?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Prequalification and preapproval both refer to a letter from a lender that specifies how much the lender is willing to lend to you, up to a certain amount and based on certain assumptions. These letters provide useful information, but are not guaranteed loan offers. There's not a lot of difference between a prequalification letter and a preapproval letter. While there are some legal distinctions, in practice both terms refer to a letter from a lender that says the lender is generally willing to lend to you, up to a certain amount and based on certain assumptions. This letter helps you to make an offer on a home, because it gives the seller confidence that you will be able to get financing to buy the home. It is not a guaranteed loan offer. Don't worry about which word lenders use. Some lenders may use the word \"prequalification\", while other lenders may call the letter a \"preapproval\". In reality, lenders' processes vary widely, and the words they use don't tell you much about a particular lender's process. The important thing is that the letter you receive provides enough information for sellers in your area to take it seriously. The best way to make sure that the letter you have will serve its purpose is to ask a local real estate agent. Lenders usually check your credit when issuing a prequalification or preapproval letter. Many people wait to get a preapproval letter until they are ready to begin shopping seriously for a home. However, getting preapproved earlier in the process can be a good way to spot potential issues with your credit in time to correct them.###"}
{"prompt":"Where can I get money for a down payment on a home mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  It depends on your situation. If you don't have cash for a down payment, there are several options available. Put off buying the home and start saving until you have enough money for a down payment. Get help from parents or other people you trust. Gifts can be used as down payments, as long as you can present a signed statement saying the money is a gift and not a third-party loan and can prove the source of money. You may be able to withdraw up to $10,000 from a traditional, SIMPLE, or Roth individual retirement account (IRA) without penalty. Generally, if you're under 59 and a half years old, you would have to pay a 10 percent tax penalty on early withdrawals. However, if the money is used to buy, build, or rebuild a first home, the penalty may be waived. Roth IRAs work differently than other IRAs. Consult a trustedtax or financialadvisor before making any withdrawalto see if this makes the most financial sense for you. In some cases, you can borrow money to make a down payment. However, you should carefully consider that option since borrowing your down payment would increase your overall debt and your monthly payments. Sometimes local non-profit or government organizations can offer you a second mortgage on special terms to replace a down payment. For eligible servicemembers or family members, VA loans do not require a down payment. Warning: Think twice before using retirement savings on your down payment. The biggest benefit of saving in an IRA is the tax-free growth of investment earnings. If you remove the principal to fund your down payment, you'll have less money in the retirement account togrow tax-free. Your savings will not grow as quickly.###"}
{"prompt":"What is private mortgage insurance?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Private mortgage insurance, also called PMI, is a type of mortgage insurance you might be required to pay for if you have a conventional loan. Like other kinds of mortgage insurance, PMI protects the lender - not you - if you stop making payments on your loan.  PMI is arranged by the lender and provided by private insurance companies. PMI is usually required when you have a conventional loan and make a down payment of less than 20 percent of the home's purchase price. If you're refinancing with a conventional loan and your equity is less than 20 percent of the value of your home, PMI is also usually required. How do I pay for PMI?. There are several different ways to pay for PMI. Some lenders may offer more than one option, while other lenders do not. Before agreeing to a mortgage, ask lenders what choices they offer. The most common way to pay for PMI is a monthly premium. This premium is added to your mortgage payment. The premium is shown on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure on page 1, in the Projected Payments section. You will get a Loan Estimate when you apply for a mortgage, before you agree to this mortgage. The premium is also shown on your Closing Disclosure on page 1, in the Projected Payments section. Sometimes you pay for PMI with a one-time up-front premium paid at closing. This premium is shown on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure on page 2, in section B. If you make an up-front payment and then move or refinance, you may not be entitled to a refund of the premium. Sometimes you pay with both up-front and monthly premiums. The up-front premium is shown on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure on page 2, in section B. The premium added to your monthly mortgage payment is shown on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure on page 1, in the Projected Payments section. Lenders might offer you more than one option. Ask the loan officer to help you calculate the total costs over a few different timeframes that are realistic for you. What factors should I consider when deciding whether to choose a loan that requires PMI?. You may be able to cancel your monthly mortgage insurance premiumonce you've accumulated a certain amount of equity in your home. Learn more about your rightsand ask lenders about their cancellation policies. Like other kinds of mortgage insurance, PMI can help you qualify for a loan that you might not otherwise be able to get. But, it may increase the cost of your loan. And it doesn't protect you if you run into problems on your mortgage - it only protects the lender.###"}
{"prompt":"What is private mortgage insurance?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Private mortgage insurance, also called PMI, is a type of mortgage insurance you might be required to pay for if you have a conventional loan. Like other kinds of mortgage insurance, PMI protects the lender - not you - if you stop making payments on your loan.  Usually, you will pay a higher interest rate for these loans. Paying a higher interest rate can be more or less expensive than PMI - it depends on a number of factors, including how long you plan to stay in the home. You may also want to ask a tax advisor about whether paying more in interest or paying PMI might affect your taxes differently. Borrowers making a low down payment may also want to consider other types of loans, such as an FHA loan. Other types of loans may be more or less expensive than a conventional loan with PMI, depending on your credit score, your down payment amount, the particular lender, and general market conditions. You may also want to consider saving up the money to make a 20 percent down payment. When you pay 20 percent down, PMI is not required with a conventional loan. You may also receive a lower interest rate with a 20 percent down payment. Ask lenders to show you detailed pricing for different options so you can see which option is the best deal. Warning: Private mortgage insurance protects the lender - not you. If you fall behind on your payments, PMI will not protect you and you can lose your home through foreclosure.###"}
{"prompt":"What kind of down payment do I need? How does the amount of down payment I make affect the terms of my mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  There are many options for making down payments. The amount of your down payment will vary by the loan you choose and the lender's requirements. Generally, the larger the down payment you are able to make, the lower the interest rate you will receive and the more likely you are to be approved. If you cannot make a down payment of 20 percent, lenders usually will require you to purchase private mortgage insurance or obtain an FHA, VA, or USDA loan. Don't forget to factor in all the upfront costs you will have in addition to the down payment. Think about all the costs that you'll likely have to deal with during the purchase process and immediately afterward. For example, you may want to pay points to lower your interest rate. You'll also have to pay closing costs, which sometimes can be substantial. And don't forget about the cost of moving and making any repairs that are needed right away. Tip: Ask about how your down payment affects your interest rate and what options you have when you shop around for different loans.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the financial considerations when thinking about buying or renting a home?\nX0X\n","completion":"   Buying a home and taking out a mortgage might make sense if: You have a steady source of income and a good record of paying your bills on time. Lenders will look at your ability to repay the mortgage and how positive your credit history is when deciding if you qualify for a loan. Home prices where you are looking to buy are stable. One risk of buying a home is that its value could go down. If that happens, you could even end up owing more on your home loan than the property is worth. You are able to pay for property taxes, homeowner's insurance, water, and other utilities which might cost more than utilities you might pay for when you're renting. You're willing to stay put for a few years. Buying and selling a home are expensive processes involving lots of fees and commissions. You'll want to stay in the home long enough to make these costs worth it. Also, if home prices aren't stable or are declining, you might find that you can't move after just a few years because you may owe more than the house is then worth. You can cover the cost of repairs and maintenance. When you own the home, you're responsible for maintenance and repairs - from small ones like a leaky faucet to major ones like replacing a roof. Be sure to build an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. The potential tax advantages make sense given your financial situation. Consult your financial or tax advisor to determine whether there are tax advantages to buying instead of renting. Tip: Learn how new mortgage rules may help you when you shop for a mortgage.###"}
{"prompt":"What is a home equity loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A home equity loan (sometimes called a HEL) allows you to borrow money using the equity in your home as collateral. Equity is the amount your property is currently worth, minus the amount of any existing mortgage on your property. You receive the money from a home equity loan as a lump sum. A home equity loan usually has a fixed interest rate - one that will not change. If you cannot pay back the HEL, the lender could foreclose on your home. If you are considering taking out a HEL to pay off your debts, you should explore alternatives with a credit counselor that do not potentially put your home at the risk of a forced sale. Moreover, home equity loans may have upfront fees and costs, so be sure to compare more than just your monthly payment when shopping around. Before taking out a home equity loan to consolidate your debts, talk to a qualified credit counselor to help you weigh your options. Look for a non-profit credit counseling organization that can: Advise you on managing your money and debts; Help you develop a budget; Give you free educational materials or workshops; Avoid firms that ask for big fees up-front or that make unrealistic promises - like restoring your credit or repaying your debts for pennies on the dollar. Start your search at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling's website or by calling (800) 388-2227. Once you've identified counselors near you, check with your local Better Business Bureau or state attorney general's office to see if any of them has a history of complaints. Tip: Be careful about borrowing against your home as part of an investment strategy. There is no such thing as a \"risk-free\" or \"guaranteed\" investment. You should carefully consider all your options before you borrow against your home to invest. All investments can lose value and that could put your home at risk if you cannot repay the loan later on.###"}
{"prompt":"What is a second mortgage loan or \"junior-lien\"?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A second mortgage or junior-lien is a loan you take out using your house as collateral while you still have another loan secured by your house. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are common examples of second mortgages. Some second mortgages are \"open-end\" (meaning you can continue to take cash out up to the maximum credit amount and, as you pay down the balance, can draw again up to the same limit) and other second mortgage loans are \"closed-end\" (in which you receive the entire loan amount upfront and cannot redraw after that). The term \"second\" means that if you can no longer pay your mortgages and your home is sold to pay off the debts, this loan is paid off second. If there is not enough equity to pay off both loans completely, your second mortgage loan lender may not get the full amount it is owed. As a result, second mortgage loans often carry higher interest rates than first mortgage loans. By taking out a second mortgage, you are adding to your overall debt burden. Anytime you add on to your overall debt burden, you make yourself more vulnerable in case you then experience financial difficulties that affect your ability to repay your debts. It is important to know that a major risk with home equity loans or home equity lines of credit is that if you cannot repay a home equity loan or home equity line of credit, you could potentially lose your home because you are using the equity in your home as collateral.###"}
{"prompt":"What is an option or payment-option ARM?\nX0X\n","completion":"  An option or payment-option ARM is an adjustable rate mortgage with several possible payment choices. Some of the payment choices do not cover the full amount needed to pay down the loan. The payment \"options\" usually include: Paying an amount that covers both your principal and interest. This is the only way you can reduce the amount you owe on your mortgage loan with each payment. Paying an amount that covers only your interest. Interest-only payments do not pay down your principal, or the amount you borrowed. Paying a minimum (or limited) amount that does not even cover the interest. The interest you do not pay will be added to your principal loan balance. This increases the amount of debt you owe.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between a fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The difference between a fixed rate and an adjustable rate mortgage is that, for fixed rates the interest rate is set when you take out the loan and will not change. With an adjustable rate mortgage, the interest rate may go up or down. Many ARMs will start at a lower interest rate than fixed rate mortgages. This initial rate may stay the same for months, one year, or a few years. When this introductory period is over, your interest rate will change and the amount of your payment is likely to go up. Part of the interest rate you pay will be tied to a broader measure of interest rates, called an index. Your payment goes up when this index of interest rates increases. When interest rates decline, sometimes your payment may go down, but that is not true for all ARMs. Some ARMs set a cap on how high your interest rate can go. Some ARMs also limit how low your interest rate can go. Know how your ARM adjusts. Before taking out an adjustable rate mortgage, find out: How high your interest rate and monthly payments can go with each adjustment; How frequently your interest rate will adjust; How soon your payment could go up; If there is a cap on how high your interest rate could go; If there is a limit on how low your interest rate could go; If you will still be able to afford the loan if the rate and payment go up to the maximums allowed under the loan contract; Tip: Don't assume you'll be able to sell your home or refinance your loan before the rate changes. The value of your property could decline or your financial condition could change. If you can't afford the higher payments on today's income, you may want to consider another loan.

{"prompt":"What is a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A mortgage is an agreement between you and a lender that gives the lender the right to take your property if you fail to repay the money you've borrowed plus interest. Mortgage loans are used to buy a home or to borrow money against the value of a home you already own. Seven things to look for in a mortgage The size of the loan; The interest rate and any associated points; The closing costs of the loan, including the lender's fees; The Annual Percentage Rate (APR); The type of interest rate and whether it can change (is it fixed or adjustable?); The loan term, or how long you have to repay the loan; Whether the loan has other risky features, such as a pre-payment penalty, a balloon clause, an interest-only feature, or negative amortization; Focus on a mortgage that is affordable for you given your other priorities, not on how much you qualify for. Lenders will tell you how much you are qualified to borrow - that is, how much they are willing to lend you. Several online calculators will compare your income and debts and come up with similar answers. But how much you could borrow is very different from how much you can afford to repay without stretching your budget for other important items too thin. Lenders do not take into account all your family and financial circumstances. To know how much you can afford to repay, you'll need to take a hard look at your family's income, expenses and savings priorities to see what fits comfortably within your budget. Don't forget other costs when coming up with your ideal payment. Costs such as homeowner's insurance, property taxes, and private mortgage insurance are typically added to your monthly mortgage payment, so be sure to include these costs when calculating how much you can afford. You can get estimates from your local tax assessor, insurance agent and lender. Knowing how much you can comfortably pay each month will also help you estimate a reasonable price range for your new home.###"}
{"prompt":"What happens to my reverse mortgage when I die?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Reverse mortgage loans typically must be repaid when you die.  What happens to the reverse mortgage will depend on several factors, including: Whether you have a co-borrower on the reverse mortgage loan, When you took out the reverse mortgage, and; Whether you were married when the loan documents were signed and continued to be married up until your death. If there's a co-borrower on the loan When there is a co-borrower on the loan, both you and the co-borrower receive the benefits of the loan and are responsible for meeting the obligations of the loan. If one borrower dies, the co-borrower will be able to remain in the home and receive loan payments as long as they meet the obligations of the reverse mortgage loan. It's a good idea to check with your reverse mortgage servicer to make sure your loan records are accurate and that you and your co-borrower are both on the loan. Call your servicer to find out what names are listed on your loan. See your reverse mortgage loan statement for the servicer's phone number or address and ask them to send you this information in writing for your records. If your spouse is not a co-borrower Your non-borrowing spouse may stay in the home if they pay off the loan. They may also be able to stay in the home without paying off the loan, depending on when the loan was originated (meaning when it was taken out) and whether they qualify as an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse under HUD's rules. An Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse will not get any money from the reverse mortgage. The process of qualifying to be an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse may be difficult. Your non-borrowing spouse may want to get help from an attorney or a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. For reverse mortgage loans with case numbers assigned on or after August 4, 2014 Your lender or servicer will determine if your non-borrowing spouse qualifies to stay in the home after you, the borrower, die or move into a healthcare facility for more than 12 consecutive months (called a \"deferral period\"). To qualify as an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse, your spouse must: Have been married to you at the time the loan documents were signed, and stay married to you up until your death.

If a salesperson or contractor offers you a PACE loan to finance a home repair or an energy-efficient improvement, it is important to understand the benefits and risks involved before you sign up. You may have other ways to finance your upgrades, so it is important to shop around. PACE loans may require no down payment, which can be helpful if you have necessary repairs and are cash-strapped. However, PACE loans have fees and interest you will have to pay over time, just like a normal loan. You will have to make payments for PACE loans through your property taxes- and it will make your property tax bill go up. For some homeowners, the increase can be large. This could also put you at risk of losing your home through a tax sale. Some of the risks include: Unaffordable payments You pay your PACE loan back plus interest and fees with your property taxes each year until it is paid off. You may have to repay the PACE loan for five, 10, or 20 years. This can lead to high assessments added to your property tax bill. You should pay attention to how long the PACE loan will last - it may be longer or shorter than other types of loans, which can affect the size of your payments. If you have a mortgage, your mortgage company will treat PACE loans like your property taxes, because your PACE payment is billed as part of your property tax payment. So, if your home goes to tax sale, any portion of your PACE loan that is delinquent will be paid before your mortgage company will be paid anything. If you have an existing mortgage escrow account that collects your tax and insurance payments, most mortgage servicers will add your PACE payments into your mortgage escrow, to make sure that they are paid timely. This would cause your mortgage payments to rise. Most lenders will not refinance your mortgage or give you a new mortgage if you have an outstanding PACE loan. If you don't have an escrow account to collect property tax payments, you will need to save up on your own to make PACE payments along with your property taxes. Salespeople may tell you - but are not required to prove - that the proposed improvements \"pay for themselves\" in lower utility payments or other rebates.###"}
{"prompt":"I am considering a PACE loan for home improvements. What should I keep in mind before signing up?\nX0X\n","completion":"  PACE loans may have certain benefits, but it can put you at risk of losing your home if you cannot afford the payments. Understand the risks before signing up.  Limited means to dispute the work or costs once you sign up Because you pay PACE loans back with your property taxes, you may have limited options if you aren't satisfied with the work, wish to dispute the charges, or can't afford the payments. If you don't have a mortgage loan that collects your property tax payments, you may have to work with the local taxing authority if you fall behind. They may not be able to help you beyond offering you a short-term payment plan, which may not be affordable. Trouble selling or refinancing your home If you want to sell your home before the PACE loan is paid off, you might face challenges completing the sale. When you sell your house, the buyer is responsible for continuing the PACE payments. Any buyer will face the same risks of losing the home if the payments are not made. That may make the home more expensive than buying another home without a PACE loan. Most lenders will not make a mortgage to the buyer when there is a PACE loan on the house. In addition, most lenders will not refinance your mortgage if there is a PACE loan on the house. This may limit the number of buyers who will be willing to purchase your home if you cannot afford to pay the PACE loan off. Loss of home equity If your home goes to tax sale, the tax authority will collect any unpaid taxes and any delinquent PACE payments, along with any penalties. This can take a large chunk of any equity in the home. Which means there will be less for you to use on other expenses, for example, if you are planning to use that equity to pay the costs of moving out of the home, or for retirement. Before deciding to sign up for a PACE loan, shop around for other options. If you have an estimate, shop around for contractors and loan options.###"}

{"prompt":"How do mortgage lenders calculate monthly payments?\nX0X\n","completion":"  For most mortgages, lenders calculate your principal and interest payment using a standard mathematical formula and the terms and requirements for your loan. The total monthly payment you send to your mortgage company is often higher than the principal and interest payment explained here. The total monthly payment often includes other things, such ashomeowners insuranceand taxes. Learn more. Fixed-rate mortgage A typical fixed-rate mortgage is calculated so that if you keep the loan for the full loan term - for example, 30 years - and make all of your payments, you will precisely pay off the loan at the end of the loan term. Learn more about how this works. The payment depends on the loan amount, the loan term, and the interest rate. You can use our calculator to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment for different scenarios. Balloon loan A balloon loan has a much shorter loan term than a regular mortgage - typically only five years - but the monthly payments are calculated as if the loan was going to last for a much longer time, typically 30 years. Because the monthly payments aren't high enough to pay off the full loan, the remaining loan balance is due as one large final payment (known as the \"balloon\" payment) at the end of the loan term. So, for example, if you had a mortgage loan of $100,000 for 30 years at an interest rate of four percent, your monthly principal and interest paymentwould be $477 per month. With a regular 30-year loan you would make this payment for 30 years. With a five-year balloon loan you would make this payment for five years and then owe the balance of the loan - or $90,448 - at the end of the fifth year. Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) If you have anadjustable-rate loan, your initial payments are calculated assuming that your initial interest rate remains the same for the entire loan term. When your interest rate adjusts, your payment will typically (though not always) be re-calculated based on the new interest rate and the remaining loan term.

{"prompt":"How does paying down a mortgage work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The amount you borrow with your mortgage is known as the principal. Each month, part of your monthly payment will go toward paying off that principal, or mortgage balance, and part will go toward interest on the loan. Interest is what the lender charges you for lending you money. Most people's monthly payments also include additional amounts for taxes and insurance. The part of your payment that goes to principal reduces the amount you owe on the loan and builds your equity. The part of the payment that goes to interest doesn't reduce your balance or build your equity. So, the equity you build in your home will be much less than the sum of your monthly payments. With a typical fixed-rate loan, the combined principal and interest payment will not change over the life of your loan, but the amounts that go to principal rather than interest will. Here's how it works: In the beginning, you owe more interest, because your loan balance is still high. So most of your monthly payment goes to pay the interest, and a little bit goes to paying off the principal. Over time, as you pay down the principal, you owe less interest each month, because your loan balance is lower. So, more of your monthly payment goes to paying down the principal. Near the end of the loan, you owe much less interest, and most of your payment goes to pay off the last of the principal. This process is known as amortization. Lenders use a standard formula to calculate the monthly payment that allows for just the right amount to go to interest vs. principal in order to precisely pay off the loan at the end of the term. You can use our calculator to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment for different loan amounts, loan terms, and interest rates.

{"prompt":"My lender offered me a home equity line of credit (HELOC). What is a HELOC?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is an \"open-end\" line of credit that allows you to borrow repeatedly against your home equity.  You \"draw\" on the line over time, usually up to some credit limit, using special checks or a credit card. As you repay the principal, you can draw that amount again. This part of the plan is known as the \"draw period,\" which usually lasts for some fixed term, such as ten years. After the draw period ends, you typically then enter the \"repayment period,\" during which you must pay off the outstanding balance in regular periodic payments of principal and interest. The repayment period is also a fixed term of years. Depending upon your lender and your HELOC agreement, you may have to pay back the whole amount you borrowed as soon as the repayment period begins. HELOCs usually have a variable interest rate that changes over time, so your payments may not be the same from month to month. If the value of your home decreases significantly, your lender may decide not to allow you to take out additional credit under your HELOC plan, which may result in you not having access to as much money as you thought you would. The lender may also freeze your ability to take out additional funds if your financial circumstances change and your lender does not believe you will be able to make your payments. If you are having trouble with your bills, taking out a HELOC to pay down your debt may cause more trouble for you and put your home at risk. Before taking out a HELOC to consolidate your debts, talk to a U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved housing counseling agency. A HUD-approved housing counseling agency can: Advise you on managing your money and debts; Help you develop a budget; Give you free educational materials or workshops; Avoid firms that ask for big fees up-front or that make unrealistic promises - like restoring your credit or repaying your debts for pennies on the dollar. Find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency by visiting HUD's website or by calling 1-800-569-4287. Tip: If you are considering a home equity line of credit, shop around to compare all your options. Just like other mortgages, HELOCs have costs and fees associated with them. Also, be sure you review the risks of this type of credit. If you do not understand the terms and conditions for your loan, ask your lender, broker, trusted financial advisor or housing counselor. The best way to avoid problems is not to sign anything you don't understand.###"}

{"prompt":"How much will a reverse mortgage loan cost?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The cost of a reverse mortgage loan will depend on the type of loan and the lender you choose. Typically, a reverse mortgage loan is more expensive than other home loans.  With a reverse mortgage loan you will owe the money you borrowed as well as interest and fees. Unlike traditional mortgage loans, the amount you owe on a reverse mortgage loan will grow over time. What will reverse mortgage counseling cost?. Borrowers taking out a HECM reverse mortgage loan, must receive counseling from a HUD-approved reverse mortgage housing counseling agency before receiving the loan. Housing counseling costs will vary depending on the agency and your individual situation. The housing counseling agency must make a determination about your ability to pay, which should include factors, including, but not limited to, income and debt obligations. HUD approved housing counseling agencies may charge you a reasonable fee, but they cannot charge you a fee if you can't afford it and must explain all charges prior to counseling. What are the other upfront costs of reverse mortgages?. Like with a traditional mortgage, borrowers will typically have to pay one-time upfront costs at the beginning of the reverse mortgage loan. These costs include: Origination fees (which cannot exceed $6,000 and are paid to the lender); Real estate closing costs (paid to third-parties) that can include an appraisal, title search, surveys, inspections, recording fees, mortgage taxes, credit checks and other fees; An initial mortgage insurance premium:There is an initial and annual mortgage insurance premium charged by your lender and paid to the Federal Housing Administration. Mortgage insurance guarantees that you will receive your expected loan advances. This insurance is different and in addition to what you have to pay for homeowners insurance. You can pay these costs in cash or by using the money from your loan. If you use your loan proceeds to pay for upfront costs, you won't have to bring any money to the closing, but the total amount of money you'll have available from the reverse mortgage loan proceeds will be less. What are the ongoing costs for reverse mortgages?. Ongoing costs are added to your loan balance each month. This means that each month you are charged interest and fees on top of the interest and fees that were added to your previous month's loan balance. Ongoing costs may include: Interest; Servicing fees paid to your lender to cover such costs as sending you account statements, distributing your loan proceeds, and making certain that you keep up with the loan requirements; Annual mortgage insurance premium which is 0.5% of the outstanding mortgage balance and; Property charges such as homeowners insurance and property taxes, and if applicable, flood insurance.###"}

{"prompt":"My appraisal is less than the sale price. What does that mean for me?\nX0X\n","completion":"  It is very risky to purchase a home for more than the appraised value. First, get a copy of the appraisal The appraisal is a professional opinion as to the value of the home you want to purchase. Appraisers have to follow rules in arriving at the value of a property, and lenders are not allowed to interfere with the appraiser's judgment. The lender is required to send you a copy of the appraisal. If you haven't received a copy, ask your lender for it. A good next step is to ask the seller to reduce the price on the home You can often use the lower appraised value to negotiate a reduction in the sales price of the home. The appraisal is strong evidence that the price was above the market value of the home. If the seller won't reduce the price on the home, you may want to cancel the sale Consider consulting an attorney about your options. Depending on the terms of your purchase contract, there may be costs associated with cancelling the sale. However, these costs are likely small compared to buying a home that isn't worth what you paid for it.###"}
{"prompt":"Why is the title insurance premium on the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure different from the premium listed on the paperwork I received from the title insurance company? Am I being charged more?\nX0X\n","completion":"  You're not necessarily being charged more if the amounts on your loan forms are different from your title insurance paperwork. The Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure are forms that went into effect on Oct. 3, 2015. Depending on the state where you are buying your home, your title insurance company may give you an itemized list of fees at closing. The itemized list of fees required under state law may be displayed differently than the same fees on the Loan Estimate or on the Closing Disclosure. That does not necessarily mean you are being charged more. If you add up all the title-related costs your title insurance company gives you, it should match the totals of all the title-related costs you see on the Loan Estimate or on the Closing Disclosure. When comparing costs for title insurance, make sure to compare the bottom line total. Note: You should have not receiveda Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosureif you applied for a mortgage or reverse mortgage prior to Oct. 3, 2015.For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate.

{"prompt":"I received a revised Loan Estimate from my lender showing a higher interest rate and increased closing costs. What does this mean?\nX0X\n","completion":"  When important information changes, your lender is required to give you a revised Loan Estimate showing how this new information affects your loan terms and closing costs. The Loan Estimate is a form that went into effect on Oct. 3, 2015. It is illegal for a lender to intentionally underestimate charges for services on the Loan Estimate, and then surprise you with higher charges on a revised Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure. However, a lender may increase the fees it quoted you on the Loan Estimate if certain circumstances change. Here are some common reasons why the estimated charges in your Loan Estimate might increase: You decide to change the kind of loan, for example moving from an adjustable-rate to a fixed-rate loan; You decide to reduce the amount of your down payment; The appraisal on the home you want to buy came in lower than expected; You took out a new loan or missed a payment on another loan, and your credit score has changed; Your lender could not verify your overtime, bonus, or other income; The interest rate on your loan was not locked, and locking the rate caused the points or lender credits to change; If your lender gives you a revised Loan Estimate, you should look it over to see what has changed. Ask your lender: \"Can you explain why I received a new Loan Estimate\"?; \"How is my loan transaction different from what I was originally expecting\"?; \"How does this change my loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment, cash to close, and other loan features\"?; Note: You won't receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to Oct. 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE)and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate.

{"prompt":"My loan officer said that I need to express my - Intent to Proceed - in order for my mortgage loan application to move forward. What does that mean?\nX0X\n","completion":"  When you are shopping for a loan, you may contact more than one potential lender to compare available options. If you intend to proceed with a particular mortgage application, you must notify your lender of your intent to proceed by telling the lender you want to move forward with the application for that loan.  If you're applying for a mortgage, it is a good idea to request Loan Estimates from three or more lenders and compare them to determine which loan offer is best for you. After you receive your Loan Estimates, it's up to you to decide whether to move forward with a mortgage application. If you decide not to proceed with an application for a particular loan, you don't need to do anything further. If you do not communicate further with the lender, the lender will most likely close out your application. If you do intend to proceed with a particular mortgage application, you must take the next step and tell the lender you want to move forward with the application for that loan. The lender is only required to honor the terms of the Estimate for 10 business days so it is important to notify the lender within those 10 days. If you wait more than 10 business days after you receive a Loan Estimate to tell the lender you intend to proceed, the lender can revise the terms and estimated costs and provide you with a revised Loan Estimate. The lender cannot assume that silence means you intend to proceed. When you first receive a Loan Estimate, find out what the lender's requirements are for proceeding with a loan application. After you have reviewed and compared Loan Estimates, make sure you take the next step of notifying the lender within 10 business days if you want to proceed with a loan application. Ask questions if any of the steps or information is unclear. Once you've notified the lender, you typically then need to pay an application or appraisal fee and provide full supporting documentation of your income, assets, and other financial information. If you delay providing documentation or other items necessary to move your loan application forward, your lender may need to delay your closing. For example, documentation of your income and assets is typically needed to approve your loan, so you'll want to send that information to the lender you have chosen as soon as possible. A delayed closing can be costly - your rate lock could expire. If your purchase contract specifies that you must close within a certain time frame, you could risk losing the home and the deposit you gave the seller. So be sure to send requested information to your lender as soon as possible.###"}

Common errors in your documents can be as simple as a name misspelled or a wrong number in an address, or as serious as incorrect loan amounts or missing pages.

Sign your closing documents only after you have carefully reviewed all of the terms on theClosing Disclosureand compared them to your Loan Estimate. Make sure that there are no errors and that you understand the reason for any increase in fees or discrepancies. You should review the Closing Disclosure before closing, as there will be many other documents to review at the closing itself. Remember there is no time limit at closing, so don't feel pressured. Take your time to review documents and ask any questions you have. You won't receive a Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure if you applied for a mortgage prior to Oct. 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate. Instead of a Closing Disclosure, you will receive a final Truth-in-Lending disclosureand a HUD-1 Settlement Statement. Lenders are not required to send you these closing documents in advance of closing. However, if you request to see a copy of your HUD-1, you can review it at least one business day before closing. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure. If you have a problem with your mortgage closing process, you should discuss the problem with your lender. You can also submit a complaint to the CFPB online or by calling. We'll forward your complaint to the company and work to get you a response - generally in 15 days. You may also wish to consult an attorney about your problem.###"}
{"prompt":"During my mortgage loan application process, I was given three or four different valuations. What do all the different valuations mean?\nX0X\n","completion":"  In general, any valuation compares the home you are trying to buy or refinance with sales information on similar homes from the same area. A valuation is an estimate of the amount of money a home may be worth. The valuation will also be based on information about the home including square footage, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and the year it was built. Valuations may also use information like tax assessments and sales information for the housing market in your area. When you buy or refinance a home, your lender will get at least one and sometimes more \"valuations\". No matter where the values came from, your lender is required to give you copies of each valuation that they have. Those valuations could include: An appraisal done by a licensed real estate appraiser who does a full inspection of the property. This is the most common type of valuation. Appraisal values are generally determined by making adjustments between the features of your home and comparable local property sales (which are called \"comps\" for short). A Broker Price Opinion, or \"BPO,\" which is an estimate of value provided by a real estate sales professional. A BPO is most commonly used to justify a home's listing price. An Automated Valuation Model, or \"AVM,\" which is a computer-generated value that uses mathematical models that compare information about the house you want to buy - number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, etc. - with recent sales figures and other information about the housing market in your area. Your lender may get an AVM when you first submit your loan application, just to make sure that the property value is in the right ball park. Later, the lender may require a full appraisal by a licensed real estate appraiser. Each of these valuations may be different because they are estimates and may be based on different comps or may have been completed at different times or for different purposes. If there is a big difference between the different valuations, your lender will have to decide which value it finds more reliable. Tip: You may also get your own independent appraisal, but you might have to pay an additional fee. If the appraisal is well below the price you offered to pay, you may want to consider renegotiating the home purchase price or reviewing the appraiser's work carefully to understand how the appraiser arrived at the estimated value.###"}

{"prompt":"What happens after I complete an application to determine my options to avoid foreclosure?\nX0X\n","completion":"  It depends on your situation, but there are steps yourservicermust usually take to evaluate your application. Make sure your servicer receives your complete application more than 37 days before your scheduled foreclosure sale. Warning: Under CFPB rules, if your servicer doesn't receive your complete application more than 37 days before your foreclosure sale, your servicer doesn't necessarily have to review your application. However, depending on what type of mortgage you have, your servicer might have to consider your application under other rules. For example, if you're applying for relief under the National Mortgage Settlement, the process may give you additional protections. Your servicer's responseIf your servicer receives your complete application more than 37 days before your scheduled foreclosure sale, you should hear back from your servicer in writing within 30 days. Your servicer may respond to your complete application in three ways: Your servicer may offer you a loss mitigation option. It will also tell you how long you have to accept the offer. This may depend on how long before your scheduled foreclosure sale you completed your application. Your servicer may deny you loss mitigation. If your servicer denies your application for a loan modification it has to tell you exactly why you were denied. If your servicer receives your complete application for loss mitigation at least 90 days before a scheduled foreclosure sale, you may also have a right to appeal if you were denied a loan modification. Your servicer may ask for additional documentation or information. If your servicer does this, you should give the servicer what it asks for as soon as possible to make sure you have all possible foreclosure protections. ForeclosureExcept in rare cases, your servicer can't start the foreclosure process until at least 120 days after you become delinquent on your loan. After that, if you aren't eligible for loss mitigation, or chose not to accept the servicer's loss mitigation offer, the servicer will usually begin the foreclosure process. The time between the start of foreclosure and the actual foreclosure sale depends on the laws in your state. Tip: You may want to check with your county clerk's office or legal services provider to find out how foreclosure works in your area. Use this checklist for more information on how to avoid foreclosure.###"}
{"prompt":"I applied for a loan modification or other options to avoid foreclosure, but was denied help. My lender said I didn't meet the qualifications for help. Can I appeal?\nX0X\n","completion":"  It depends. You can only appeal when you're denied for a loan modification program. You can ask for a review of a denied loan modification if: You sent in a complete mortgage assistance application at least 90 days before your foreclosure sale; and; Your servicer denied you for any trial or permanent loan modification it offers. Your servicer does not have to review decisions about other loss mitigation programs like a short sale. Tip: If you've been denied a loan modification and you want to appeal the decision, contact your servicer to begin the process. Your appeal needs to be submitted within 14 days after the servicer denies your application for a loan modification. The servicer has to assign the review of your appeal to someone who was not responsible for the initial decision and must give you a response in writing within 30 days of your appeal. If the servicer denies your appeal you cannot appeal further. If the servicer decides to make you an offer after reviewing your appeal, you're entitled to 14 days to accept or reject that offer. Sometimes you might be considered for more than one loan modification program. Let's say your lender denied you one loan modification program, but offered you others. You then appealed the denial, but your lender upheld its original decision. In this case, you would have 14 days from the time your lender upheld this decision to accept the lender's original offer. If you have a problem with your mortgage, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling.###"}
{"prompt":"I got a letter from my mortgage servicer about my application for help to prevent foreclosure of my mortgage. Can you help me understand some of the terms?\nX0X\n","completion":"  When you apply for help inavoiding foreclosureyou are likely to come across words and technical terms that may be unfamiliar to you.  This is another reason why it's a good idea to get professional help from aHUD-Approved Housing Counseling Agency. Here are a few common terms you may find when you prepare your application: Loss mitigation Loss mitigation refers to the steps mortgage servicers take to work with a mortgage borrower to avoid foreclosure. Loss mitigation refers to a servicer's responsibility to reduce or \"mitigate\" the loss to the investor that can come from a foreclosure. Certain loss-mitigation options may help you stay in your home. Other options may help you leave your home without going through foreclosure. Loss mitigation options may include deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, forbearance, repayment plan, short sale, or a loan modification. Hardship Most loss-mitigation applications require you to describe the change in financial circumstances that is preventing you from paying your mortgage. This is referred to as your \"hardship\". A hardship may be unemployment, temporary or permanent disability, uninsured medical expenses for a family member, divorce, death, or other circumstances generally beyond your control that significantly reduce your income or increase your expenses. When you submit your application, you should explain your hardship and be able to provide evidence, such as a copy of a divorce decree or checks you wrote to pay hospital bills. Investor requirement After your lender gives you a mortgage, it may sell your mortgage to another investor. If your mortgage has been sold to an investor and you run into trouble making payments, the investor will determine what type of loss-mitigation assistance is available to you if you file a complete application for assistance. Though the new mortgage rules do not require investors to offer alternatives to foreclosure, most investors do so because avoiding foreclosure can reduce their losses. Tip: You have the right to know who the owner or investor is and how to contact them. Net Present Value calculation Investors may use a mathematical formula to figure out if they are financially better off foreclosing on your loan or offering you an alternative that avoids a foreclosure. This formula is called a \"Net Present Value\" or \"NPV\" calculation. When you apply for loss mitigation, the investor or the mortgage servicer will generally calculate the Net Present Value of the loss-mitigation options that may be available to you and use that information to determine whether to go through with a foreclosure.###"}
{"prompt":"I got a letter from my mortgage servicer about my application for help to prevent foreclosure of my mortgage. Can you help me understand some of the terms?\nX0X\n","completion":"  When you apply for help inavoiding foreclosureyou are likely to come across words and technical terms that may be unfamiliar to you.  If so, you have the right to certain information that was used in the NPV calculation and you should check to make sure that information is accurate. If you need assistance understanding the NPV calculation you can use the CFPB's \"Find a Counselor\" tool to get a list of housing counseling agencies in your area that are approved by HUD. You can also call the HOPE Hotline, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Trial modification Under certain circumstances, your servicer may offer to permanently change or \"modify\" your loan so that your monthly payment is reduced. Usually, your servicer will first put you in a trial modification for a few months to make sure that you are able make the new payment. If you make the trial payments as agreed, your servicer should finish the paperwork to make the change permanent. Your servicer may not start a new foreclosure (or if you are already in foreclosure, may not complete the foreclosure sale) so long as you pay your trial-period payments on time. However, your loan may still be considered delinquent for some purposes during the trial period, because you are making payments that are less than your regular amount.###"}
{"prompt":"What is arbitration and how does it affect my mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Arbitration is a way to address disputes outside the court system. If you have an issue with your mortgage loan, some protections that are generally available to you in court, like the right to appeal, may not be available in arbitration. A person called an arbitrator listens to each side and decides how to resolve the dispute. In the past, mortgage lenders would sometimes include \"mandatory arbitration clauses\" in mortgage agreements. These clauses made you agree to resolve certain types of disputes in arbitration rather than in court. Mortgage lenders are no longer allowed to include \"mandatory arbitration clauses\" in mortgage agreements. You can't be required to accept mandatory arbitration. You can agree to resolve an issue through arbitration if you think that's a better way of resolving the dispute. If you have a problem with your mortgage, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling.###"}
{"prompt":"Does my mortgage servicer have to help me avoid foreclosure?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Many mortgage servicers have to work with you to see if you qualify for ways to avoid foreclosure. Your servicer may refer to this as loss mitigation. ;###"}
{"prompt":"My mortgage lender told me it was exempt from mortgage servicing rules. Is this true?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Maybe. Your lender could be exempt from certain mortgage servicing rules if it is a \"small servicer\".  Definition of small servicer Your lender is considered a small servicer if it: Services 5,000 mortgages or less each year together with any related companies and made or owns all of the loans it services. Is a Housing Finance Agency, which is a government agency that offers a certain amount of mortgages with low rates for low- and middle-income homes. Small servicers are exempt from certain rules that larger servicers must follow, such as about how they provide billing statements and contact you about your loan. Also, the rule about whether or not a servicer can charge you for home insurance you didn't choose applies differently to small servicers. Small servicer requirements Though small servicers are exempt from certain requirements there are new rules that they must follow. For example, small servicers must: Tell you each time a change in your interest rate causes your payment to change. Credit your mortgage payment to your account on the day they receive it. Provide a payoff balance to you within 7 business days if you request it in writing. Follow guidelines to make sure that you are not charged for force-placed insurance unless it is necessary. A mortgage servicer may make you pay for force-placed insurance if you are not paying for hazard insurance on your home. However, the insurance your lender makes you pay for must cost less than the hazard insurance the servicer would pay for from your escrow account. Respond to your requests to fix errors the servicer made or send you information about your loan in a certain amount of time:Acknowledge the request within five business days. Correct the error or investigate and provide you with a reason why there is no error, generally within 30 to 45 business days.

{"prompt":"My mortgage lender told me it was exempt from mortgage servicing rules. Is this true?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Maybe. Your lender could be exempt from certain mortgage servicing rules if it is a \"small servicer\".  Your mortgage loan is more than 120 calendar days delinquent; The foreclosure is based on a violation of the due-on-sale clause in your contract (which says that you must pay off your mortgage when you sell your home to someone else); or; The servicer is joining a foreclosure action made by a subordinate lienholder (subordinate lienholders are also sometimes called second or junior lienholders).###"}
{"prompt":"I was told I'm buying a home that was flipped and that I have to get a second appraisal. How does that work?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If the home you're buying is considered a \"flip\" and you're getting ahigher-priced mortgageloan covered under new mortgage rules, you will have to get a secondappraisal. A \"flip\" is when: You buy a home from a seller who bought the home less than six months ago and; You pay a certain amount more than the seller paid for the home:10 percent more if the seller bought the home within the past 90 days.20 percent more if the seller bought the home in the past 91 to 180 days. 10 percent more if the seller bought the home within the past 90 days. 20 percent more if the seller bought the home in the past 91 to 180 days. When you buy a \"flipped\" home, your lender must pay for a second appraisal of the home that includes an inside inspection. The lender cannot charge you for this second appraisal.

{"prompt":"I saw an ad for a no-payment reverse mortgage from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Is this legitimate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No. The VA does not offer no-payment reverse mortgages. Some mortgage lenders run misleading ads directed at veterans that promise special deals, imply VA approval, or offer a \"no-payment\" reverse mortgage to attract older Americans desperate to stay in their homes. You should look out for and avoid loans that advertise: Official-looking logos implying that the loan comes from a government agency like the VA or the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).Government agencies guarantee some loans, but they do not lend directly. Promises of amazingly low rates. Offers of rates as low 1.9 percent for \"VA refinancing\" may turn out to only be in effect for a short period of time. Promises that a reverse mortgage will let veterans stay in their home payment-free. Typically, borrowers with these mortgages must still pay their taxes and insurance and could lose their homes if they don't.

{"prompt":"What should I do if the house or apartment I'm renting goes into foreclosure?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Know Your Rights, look for notices, ask questions. You may want to consult an attorney.  If your landlord stops paying the mortgage, foreclosure proceedings may begin. Some state and local laws may offer protections for renters in the foreclosure process. More information about landlord-tenant laws in your state is available as well as a summary of state and local tenant protections from foreclosure. Tip:If you need help finding an attorney, you can view this list ofresources from the American Bar Association and you can find your local legal aid office or volunteer attorney program. Be aware of the following: Look for notices. If notices of a possible foreclosure are delivered to or posted on your property, contact the sender right away and let them know that you are a tenant. You should also contact your landlord. Ask questions. You may get confusing information from your landlord about the foreclosure. For example, the landlord may ask you to prepay your rent in violation of your lease or rental agreement. Your landlord may also tell you that the foreclosure is a \"mistake,\" or say that the problem has been resolved. To be sure, check with the office where deeds are recorded in the county where the property is located. \"Land records,\" \"auditor,\" \"recorder,\" or \"assessor\" are names commonly used to describe the office where a foreclosure notice or other document (often called a \"lis pendens\") has been recorded. You may also want to check court filings against your landlord. Know Your Rights. During the foreclosure process, you need to know what your options are under your state and local laws. They can vary greatly from state to state. In order to decide what to do, you may want to know:How long the foreclosure may take; How much time you have to move after a foreclosure sale; If there are any other specific tenant protections in your state.

You may be able to get some of this information by calling the local courthouse. Rent control\/Just cause eviction and Section 8. If your state or local laws have rent control or \"just cause eviction\" requirements, you may be protected from eviction after foreclosure. \"Just cause\" laws limit the reasons a landlord can terminate a lease or evict a tenant. Depending on the state or local law, the foreclosure alone may not justify an eviction or termination of your lease or rental agreement.###"}
{"prompt":"What should I do if the house or apartment I'm renting goes into foreclosure?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Know Your Rights, look for notices, ask questions. You may want to consult an attorney.  Usually, Section 8 leases can only be terminated for good cause, which means that you can't be evicted just because of a foreclosure. But you may need a lawyer to protect your rights. Utility shut-offs. If your landlord is unable to pay the mortgage, the landlord may also not be paying the utilities, and your utility service may be shut-off. You should immediately contact the utility and the landlord if a shut-off notice is sent or if your utilities are shut off. You may be able to avoid the shut-off by contacting the utility and directly paying them, even if the utilities are in the landlord's name. Move. Once a foreclosure sale occurs, you may be required to move, often in as little as thirty days or less. You should remove all of your belongings when you move so the new property owner does not take or destroy them. Protect yourself. If someone contacts you claiming to be the new property owner, ask to see documents that show ownership. Do this before paying rent, signing a new lease agreement, or allowing them to come inside the property. Scammers review publicly available foreclosure recordings and may contact tenants living in foreclosed properties to falsely demand rent. Negotiate. If the new owner wants you to move out, ask if they will give you some money to help pay moving expenses. This is sometimes referred to as a \"cash for keys\" agreement. Sometimes the bank or the new owner after a foreclosure sale is willing to do this. Deposits. If your landlord was not paying the mortgage, it may be difficult for you to get back any money you paid to your landlord as a deposit or prepaid rent. If the landlord did not refund your deposit or transfer it to the new owner after the foreclosure sale, you may need to take legal action to get back your deposit.###"}

{"prompt":"Should I use a reverse mortgage to consolidate my debts?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Using a reverse mortgage loan to consolidate debt can be risky because if you fail to meet your obligations with a reverse mortgage loan, you may lose your home to foreclosure. If you take out a reverse mortgage loan to consolidate your debts, you are using the equity in your home to pay off existing creditors. Equity is the amount your property is currently worth, minus the amount of any existing mortgage on your property. What to know about consolidating debt with a reverse mortgage A reverse mortgage is not free money. It is a loan where the borrowed money, interest, and fees must be paid back. The reverse mortgage loan you take out may end up costing you more than if you had just paid your debt payments. If you use a reverse mortgage loan to consolidate your debt, your home equity may not be available when you're older and more likely to have less income and higher healthcare bills. Many people don't succeed in paying off their debt by taking on more debt, unless they lower their spending. Contact a nonprofit credit counselor A nonprofit credit counselor can help you weigh your choices and help you to decide how you want to use credit in the future. This will help prevent future problems similar to what led you to consider debt consolidation. Also, talk to a HUD-approved reverse mortgage counseling agency before consolidating your debts with a reverse mortgage loan. HUD-approved reverse mortgage counseling agencies have the latest information on reverse mortgage loans and can help you make the best choice for you based on your financial situation and personal needs. Note: This information only applies to Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), which are the most common type of reverse mortgage loan.###"}
{"prompt":"What happens if my reverse mortgage loan balance grows larger than the value of my home?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If your loan balance is more than the value of your home, you or your heirs may not have to pay the difference. If you owe more than your home is worth, but sell your home for the appraised fair market value, the remaining balance will be paid by mortgage insurance. When the last remaining borrower passes away, the loan has to be repaid. Most heirs will repay the loan by selling the home. If your loan balance is more than the value of your home, your heirs won't have to pay more than 95 percent of the appraised value. The remaining balance of the loan is covered by mortgage insurance. Note: This information only applies to Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), which are the most common type of reverse mortgage loan.###"}
{"prompt":"Can a creditor ask me about the alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments that I or my co-signer receive?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A creditor may ask whether income stated in your application comes from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. However, the creditor must tell you that you do not have to reveal such income if you do not want it considered.###"}
{"prompt":"If I need to have a co-signer, can a lender or broker require that it be my spouse?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No. If you do not individually qualify, the creditor such as a lender or broker may request a co-signer, guarantor, endorser, or similar party. Your spouse may function as this additional party. But a lender or broker cannot require that it be your spouse.###"}
{"prompt":"My lender or broker said that my spouse had to co-sign my mortgage loan. Is this right?\nX0X\n","completion":"  In general, a creditor such as a lender or broker cannot require your spouse's (or another person's) signature for individual credit if you qualify on your own for the amount and terms requested. If you are applying for joint credit, however, a lender or broker may require your spouse's signature (or the signature of the person with whom you are applying). If you apply for a mortgage or home equity loan, a lender or broker may require your spouse's (or other person's) signature on any instrument necessary to make the property being offered as security available to satisfy the debt if you were to fail to repay. For example, a lender or broker may require your spouse (or other person) to sign an instrument to create a valid lien or pass clear title.###"}
{"prompt":"I got divorced, and my lender terminated my home equity line of credit. Can they do that?\nX0X\n","completion":"  With respect to open-end accounts (like home equity lines of credit) for which you are responsible, a creditor such as a lender generally may not make you reapply, change the terms of your account, or close your account because you reached a certain age, retired, changed your name, or changed your marital status. A lender may require you to reapply if your marital status changed, if you originally qualified for the account based on your spouse's income, and if your income alone may not support the amount of credit currently available on the account. While a reapplication is pending, the lender must allow you full access to the account. The lender may specify a reasonable time period to reapply. A lender may also close an account on which you and your spouse are jointly liable when one or both of you tell the lender you are no longer willing to be responsible for future charges, request separate accounts, or request that the account be closed. The lender may do so even if this occurs at the same time as a change in your marital status.###"}
{"prompt":"I am not married but want to submit a joint application for a mortgage or home equity loan with another person. Can we be treated differently from married joint applicants?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Generally, a creditor such as a lender or broker must evaluate married and unmarried applicants by the same standards.

{"prompt":"I am married or was previously married, and I am applying for a mortgage loan or home equity line of credit in my own name. Can a lender or broker ask me about my spouse or former spouse?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A creditor may request information about your spouse or former spouse only in certain cases. Generally, a creditor such as a lender or broker may request information about your spouse or former spouse only in the following cases: Your spouse or former spouse will be allowed to use the account; Your spouse or former spouse will be responsible for paying debts on the account; You are relying on your spouse's income or former spouse's income to repay the credit requested; You reside in a \"community property\" state; You are relying on property located in a \"community property\" state to repay the credit requested; You are relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments from a spouse or former spouse to repay the credit requested;###"}
{"prompt":"If I am married, can a lender or broker turn down my application for a mortgage or home equity loan in my own name?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you are applying for individual credit in your own name, a creditor such as a lender or broker may not deny you credit because of your marital status. If you are creditworthy, you may get your own mortgage or home equity loan, and a lender or broker generally may not require that your spouse co-sign. If you apply for a mortgage or home equity loan, a lender or broker may require your spouse's (or other person's) signature on any instrument necessary to make the property being offered as security available to satisfy the debt if you were to fail to repay. For example, a lender or broker may require your spouse (or other person) to sign an instrument to create a valid lien or pass clear title.###"}
{"prompt":"I was told that I was too young to get a mortgage loan. Is this possible?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A creditor such as a lender or broker cannot discriminate against a credit applicant because of age unless the applicant is too young to legally enter into a contract. State law governs the age at which an individual can enter into a legally binding contract.###"}
{"prompt":"I just started a new business and tried to get a mortgage loan for my business. I think that the lender discriminated against me and my company. What are my rights under the law?\nX0X\n","completion":"   Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), it is illegal for a creditor such as a lender or broker to discriminate in any business credit transaction against any applicant because of: Race; Color; Religion; National origin; Sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity); Marital status; Age (if the applicant is old enough to enter into a contract); Receipt of income from any public assistance program; Exercising in good faith a right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, which is a collection of consumer protection statutes relating to credit; this includes filing a billing dispute with a card issuer; The law applies even if a partnership or corporation applies for a loan. This means that a lender or broker may not use any of the above grounds as a reason to: Discourage you from applying for business credit; Refuse you business credit if you qualify for it; Provide you business credit on terms that are different from the terms given to someone else who is similarly situated to you, such as having similar creditworthiness; If you believe that you were discriminated against on any of these grounds, you can file an official complaint or tell us about your experience. In addition, state or local law may prohibit discrimination on additional grounds. If you think you may have been a victim of discrimination, you may also want to consult an attorney.

{"prompt":"If I have problems with my credit history, can I still get a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  You still may qualify for a mortgage despite the problems in your credit history. Lenders look at a variety of factors when evaluating a mortgage loan application. If you have weaknesses in your credit history, you may qualify for a U. S. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan. You may also qualify for a subprime mortgage, but note that subprime mortgages may have much higher interest rates than most other mortgages. Subprime loans may have other features that influence your rate, such as the possibility that your rate will rise steeply during its lifetime. If you have a bad credit history or a low credit score, you might consider delaying a home purchase and taking some time to rebuild your credit history and credit score. A housing counselor or programs offered by state and local governments and nonprofit organizations can help identify ways for you to improve your credit history. Call the CFPB to be connected to a U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved housing counselor today. Tip: Be proactive in dealing with credit. If you are having trouble paying creditors on time, the sooner you talk to your creditors the more likely it is you can work something out with them, such as a temporary payment plan. If you need help, look locally for a credit counselor but check to make sure they are trustworthy. If you are having trouble with your mortgage, call the CFPB Consumer Hotline and ask to be connected to the HOPETM Hotline. If you start to get debt collection mail or calls from someone you've never heard of, it could be that one of your debts was sold to a debt collector, or it could be a case of identity theft. Ignoring the problem usually makes it worse. Ask the creditor in writing for verification of the alleged debt to be mailed to you so you can determine whether it is a debt you owe.###"}
{"prompt":"I am a veteran with either a VA-guaranteed mortgage or a non-VA-guaranteed mortgage and am having trouble making my payments. Who can I call for help?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you are a veteran, it is important to know that there are special resources available to you, regardless of when you served and even if you don't have a VA-guaranteed mortgage. If you have a VA-guaranteed mortgage and are having trouble making your payments, the VA has a Loan Guaranty Home Loan Program to help you try to keep your home. Call to reach the nearest Loan Guaranty office where loan specialists are prepared to discuss potential ways to help with your VA loan. If you are a veteran or servicemember with a non-VA loan, the VA can still provide you with helpful advice and guidance, including information on options for refinancing to a VA-guaranteed mortgage. For more information on the VA's Loan Guaranty Home Loan Program, visit the VA's website or call toll-free to speak with a VA Loan Technician. For additional assistance, call the CFPB Consumer Hotline to be connected to a U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved housing counselor who can provide further assistance. If this is an emergency, and you are a veteran who feels you may be facing homelessness as a result of losing your home, call (877) 4AID VET (877-424-3838) or go to the VA's website to receive immediate assistance from VA.###"}
{"prompt":"I'm a servicemember or veteran and I have a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from the VA. Why do I have to apply and qualify at a bank if the VA has already certified me?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The VA loan guaranty provides a private lender with the assurance that if something goes wrong and you are unable to make the payments, the lender may go to the VA to cover its losses. With your Certificate of Eligibility, you have evidence that the VA will \"stand behind\" your loan. This VA guaranty is certainly considered by the lender, but VA loans are underwritten, closed, and serviced entirely by private lenders, not by the VA. Servicemembers and veterans have to go through the application process and provide information related to repayment ability, just like any other loan applicant. If you have additional questions or concerns, visit VA's home loan website or call (877) 827-3702.###"}
{"prompt":"I'm a servicemember or veteran and currently have a conventional mortgage at an adjustable rate. Now that rates are low, I'd like to refinance to a lower fixed rate. Would I be eligible for a VA loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes, you may be eligible for a VA loan. Because of the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, veterans who would like to refinance their existing non-VA mortgages into a VA loan may be eligible to do so for up to 100 percent of the value of the property. This may allow qualifying veterans to lower their monthly payments and avoid foreclosure. Visit the VA's website or call for further assistance.###"}
{"prompt":"I am a servicemember or veteran and I've already bought and sold one house that was financed through a VA loan. Can I qualify for another VA loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Generally, your VA loan eligibility can be restored if you have paid off your prior VA loan even if the person who assumed it was also eligible for the benefit. Once your eligibility is restored, you may qualify for another VA loan. To learn more about eligibility or for any other question regarding the program, please visit the VA's home loan program's website.###"}
{"prompt":"I am in the military and I'm in the process of closing on my first VA home loan. I hear that servicemembers and veterans do not have to pay many of the closing costs associated with a typical closing. How do I know what I should pay and what I should not pay?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The VA program does have limits on fees, compared to many other mortgage loan programs. Three business days before closing, your lender provides you with a form called the Closing Disclosure. This form lists all the fees associated with getting the loan and breaks them down into categories to clearly indicate who pays what fee. Page 3 of the Closing Disclosure shows what fees you are responsible for and how much money you need to pay to close on the loan. It's a good idea to bring your Loan Estimate, Closing Disclosure, and any other loan documents to your Legal Assistance Office for review. If that's not possible, you may download a pamphlet that explains your fees from the VA's home loan website. If you still have questions or concerns, call your regional VA office or call the VA main Home Loan information line for assistance. Note: You won't receive a Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure if you applied for a mortgage prior to Oct. 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE)and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate. Instead of a Closing Disclosure, you will receive a final Truth-in-Lending disclosure and a HUD-1 Settlement Statement. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.###"}

{"prompt":"My servicer offered me a shared appreciation mortgage as a means of modification. What does that mean?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Under a shared appreciation mortgage, you agree to give your lender a share of any increase in the value of your home. Depending on how your home value changes over time, the lender's share of the value of your home might be worth more than the balance you owe on the loan. Because you give up part of your future gains, the interest rate and monthly payments on your loan will typically be lower than the market rate for other types of loans. The lender will collect its part of the increase in your home value when the loan is repaid.###"}

HELOC lenders can refuse to allow you to refinance your first mortgage loan. If your HELOC lender refuses to let you refinance, you may need to pay off the HELOC in order to refinance.###"}
{"prompt":"Why can't I get any more money from my HELOC?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Many lenders reserve the right to reduce the amount you can borrow from your HELOC or to suspend your ability to borrow any more money from it. The reasons include: The value of your home goes down significantly; The lender reasonably believes you may no longer be able to make your payments based on a material change in your financial circumstances; You default on a material provision of your agreement (for example, by moving out of the house or taking out another loan on your home that could affect your lender's ability to be repaid); A lender can suspend or reduce your HELOC if the value of your home falls significantly, even if you have a good payment record. If your HELOC has been reduced or suspended, your lender must notify you in writing no later than three business days after the change and the notice should tell you why the lender took this action.###"}

{"prompt":"What happens if I have a reverse mortgage and I have to move out of my home, such as moving into a nursing home or to live with family?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Reverse mortgage loans typically must be repaid either when you move out of the home or when you die. However, you may not need to immediately pay it back if you are away from your home for more than 12 consecutive months in a healthcare facility or have a co-borrower or Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse living in the home. If your spouse or person living with you is a co-borrower If you move out of your home for any reason such as to live in a nursing home, or downsize to a smaller house and your spouse or the person living with you is a co-borrower on the reverse mortgage loan, they can stay in the home and continue to receive loan disbursements as long as they fulfill the ongoing obligations of the reverse mortgage. If your spouse or person living with you isn't a co-borrower If your spouse or partner is not a co-borrower and you move someplace else for the majority of the year, the reverse mortgage loan will need to be paid back. The most common way to pay back a reverse mortgage is by selling the home, in which case your spouse or partner will have to move. If you are away from your home and in a healthcare facility such as a hospital, assisted living, nursing home, or rehabilitation center for more than 12 consecutive months, your non-borrowing spouse may be able to stay in the home without paying off the loan, depending on when you took out (\"originated\") the loan. and whether they qualify as an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse under HUD's rules. Qualifying as an \"Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse\" can be difficult, so your spouse may want to consider contacting an attorney or HUD-approved housing counseling agency.

{"prompt":"My payment was returned to me, and the servicer notified me it is no longer servicing my loan. Then I got another notice in the mail saying I was late on my payment, but no one ever notified me that I needed to send my payment somewhere else. What can I do?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If the servicing rights for your loan are sold, your old and new servicers must notify you of the transfer of the servicing rights to your loan. The notice should disclose to you the date on which your old servicer will stop accepting payments and the date on which your new servicer will begin to accept payments. It should also disclose the new servicer's name, customer inquiry address, telephone number for an employee or department of the new servicer, and the effective transfer date. Failure to send your payments to the right servicer after you receive notification that the servicing rights on your loan have been sold could result in your payments not being credited properly. Generally, the entity that is selling the servicing rights must provide you with a notice no less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer, and your new servicer must deliver a transfer notice not more than 15 days after the effective transfer date. If the two notices are combined, then the combined notice must be delivered to the borrower no less than 15 days before the effective transfer date. You should also consult an attorney. If you need help finding an attorney, you can view this list of legal aid services in your state, or you can find lawyer referrals in your county and state by visiting the American Bar Association website.

{"prompt":"My mortgage servicer refuses to accept my payment. What can I do?\nX0X\n","completion":"  First, be sure you've followed your mortgage servicer's instructions for how to submit your mortgage payment. Next, call or write a letter to your servicer requesting an explanation.  Learn more about how to request information from your servicer. It's crucial that you find a way to make your mortgage payment by the due date because failing to make your mortgage payment on time could result in additional fees and charges, such as late fees, and could eventually put your home at risk of foreclosure. What to do if you can't make your mortgage payment If your loan is a closed end consumer credit transaction secured by your principal dwelling, servicers are generally not required to accept mortgage payments that don't equal a \"periodic payment,\" or the amount that covers the principal, interest, and escrow. If you can't make a periodic payment, you can call your servicer to explain that you're trying to make a partial payment on your loan. If you do send a partial payment, your mortgage servicer may be permitted by law to either credit your partial payment to your account, return the payment to you without cashing it, or keep it in a \"suspense account\" until you've paid more money to equal the full periodic payment. You can ask if your servicer will accept a partial payment or work with you to agree on a repayment plan or loan modification. If you're making partial payments, it can be confusing to know exactly how much money you owe each month. Be sure to check your most recent mortgage statement or to contact your servicer to determine the amount due and to confirm that your servicer has applied your previous payments to your loan correctly. If you're behind on your mortgage payments, your servicer may be required to contact you over the phone or in person, and then in writing, to give you information about whether you might be eligible for a repayment plan, loan modification, or other solution.

{"prompt":"What can I do if my mortgage lender or servicer is charging me for force-placed homeowner's insurance?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Make sure you have your own homeowner's insurance and send proof to your mortgage servicer. If you don't have homeowner's insurance, or don't have enough homeowner's insurance, or your homeowner's insurance has lapsed, here are steps you can take: Contact your insurance carrier as soon as possible and get a new insurance policy or ask to have your old policy reinstated. If you don't do this, you may have to pay for costly force-placed homeowner's insurance if you're not otherwise covered. Once you have a new or reinstated homeowner's insurance policy in place, send proof of the policy and any other information that your mortgage servicer has requested to your mortgage servicer. Request that your mortgage servicer cancel the force-placed insurance policy it obtained for you as soon as possible. If you disagree with an action your mortgage servicer took with your insurance, you can send a notice of error, which is a letter to your mortgage servicer saying that there was an error and disputing the error. Your servicer may require force-placed insurance when you do not have your own insurance policy or if your own policy doesn't meet the requirements of your mortgage contract. In many instances, this insurance protects only the lender, not you. The servicer will charge you for the insurance. Force-placed insurance is usually more expensive than finding an insurance policy yourself. If your homeowner's insurance coverage was cancelled because your mortgage servicer failed to make timely insurance premium payments from your escrow account, then you may want to consult an attorney. If you have a problem with your mortgage, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling.###"}
{"prompt":"What should I do if I get a tax bill from the city or county saying that my mortgage servicer did not pay my taxes?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Send a notice of error to your servicer and contact your tax authority and insurance carrier as soon as possible. If your mortgage servicer did not pay your taxes, you should send a copy of the bill along with a notice of error, which is a letter disputing the error, to your mortgage servicer. Meanwhile, if the servicerhas failed to make timely tax and insurance payments from your escrow account on your behalf, you should contact your tax authority or insurance carrier as soon as possible. If you don't or your servicer doesn't pay the property taxes, a tax lien may be put on your property. If you have an escrow account and your mortgage servicer fails to pay your property taxes, you may want to consult an attorney or a housing counselor. You can use the CFPB's \"Find a Counselor\" tool to get a list of housing counseling agencies in your area that are approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can also call the HOPE Hotline, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, If you are facing imminent foreclosure or have been served with legal papers, you may also need to consult an attorney.

{"prompt":"I mailed my mortgage payment before it was due but my servicer received it after the due date and charged me a late fee. Can my servicer do this?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes, your servicer can charge you a late fee if it receives your payment after the due date, even if you mailed your payment on time. Most servicers do not go by the postmark on your payment envelope but by when they receive your payment, though some states have laws that may regulate servicers' assessments of late fees. Be sure you allow time for transit when you mail your payment. If your servicer receive your payment before the due date, but delayed posting it until after the due date, charging late fees is inappropriate. Should the servicer refuse to remove the fee, you can file a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling.###"}
{"prompt":"Why did my monthly mortgage payment go up or change?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Several things can cause your mortgage payment to change. Check your mortgage statement or contact your servicer and ask them to explain.  There are several reasons why your monthly mortgage payment may have changed. Some examples include: You have an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) and the interest rate changed. Check the type of mortgage you have. Some homeowners believe that they have a fixed-rate mortgage loan, when their loan actually includes an adjustable-rate or some other feature that can cause their interest rate and payment to change. You have an interest-only or pay-option loan and you are starting to pay principal. With these loans, you can postpone making principal payments for a while. That means that for a period of time you are only paying off the interest that's accumulating on the amount you borrowed to pay for your home. Eventually, you have to start paying principal, or the actual amount you owe on the home, and that will make the monthly payments go up. You have an escrow account to pay for property taxes or homeowners insurance premiums, and your property taxes or homeowners insurance premiums went up. Check your monthly mortgage statement. If your monthly mortgage payment includes the amount you have to pay into your escrow account, then your payment will also go up if your taxes or premiums go up. Learn more aboutescrow payments. You have a decrease in your interest rate or your escrow payments. It could also be because you stopped paying for private mortgage insurance. If you have private mortgage insurance, your payments may change once you are able to and do cancel the insurance. You were charged new fees. Your servicer may have charged you fees that increased your monthly payment. Check your monthly mortgage statement or any correspondence you recently received from your lender or servicer. It's also possible that your mortgage servicer simply made a mistake. If you think your servicer made a mistake, first call your servicer to check. While on the phone, explain the situation to the servicer. Ask for a corrected statement. Also, ask for a reference number and the name of the person you are talking to, and take detailed notes on what you talked about and the date of the call, so you can keep track for your records. If your servicer doesn't fix the problem over the phone, send a notice of error to your servicer explaining why you think it made a mistake in calculating your loan payment. Make sure you send the notice to the address your servicer uses for errors and information requests.###"}

{"prompt":"Someone offered to write an information request or error dispute to my mortgage servicer for a fee. Can I do this for free?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. You don't have to pay anyone to write an information request or an error dispute to your servicer. You can do this yourself. Learn more about requesting information from or disputing an error with your mortgage servicer. If you're writing to request information from your mortgage servicer, remember: Include your name, property address, and mortgage account number. Use the name that is on your mortgage. Identify the information you are requesting. Don't write your letter on your payment coupon or other payment form you get from your mortgage servicer. Make sure you mail the letter to the right address. A mortgage servicer may use a special address for borrowers to send information requests.

{"prompt":"Can my mortgage servicer report negative information about me to a credit-reporting agency after I have sent an error dispute or information request?\nX0X\n","completion":"  It depends.

{"prompt":"Can I be charged a penalty for paying off my mortgage early?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Whether you can be charged a penalty for paying off your mortgage early depends on what type of mortgage you have and the specific terms of your mortgage loan. Some loans have pre-payment penalties during the first years of the loan. These fees may impose substantial costs on homeowners with adjustable rate mortgage loans who want to refinance before their rates increase, and some fixed mortgages have prepayment penalties as well. Many states have laws that limit the amount or duration of these penalties. Whether your loan carries a prepayment penalty must have been disclosed in your loan documents. Sometimes it is only disclosed in something called the \"Addendum to the Note\" - look at the Note and anything with \"Addendum\" in the title.###"}
{"prompt":"Someone offered me the ability to make 26 bi-weekly mortgage payments a year for a fee. Is there a way I can pay down my loan faster on my own without paying a fee to sign up for this plan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  In the bi-weekly payment plan, the servicer is collecting half of your monthly payment every two weeks, resulting in 26 payments over the course of the year (totaling one extra monthly payment per year). By making additional payments and applying your payments to the principal, you may be able to pay off your loan early. Before choosing a bi-weekly payment, be sure to review your loan terms to see if you will be subject to a pre-payment penalty if you do so. Check if your servicer charges any fees for a bi-weekly payment plan. You may be able to accomplish the same goal without the fee by making an extra monthly mortgage payment each year. Tip: Even if you don't set up a bi-weekly plan with your servicer, you can accomplish the same goal of paying down your loan faster by: Making one extra mortgage payment a year on your own; or; Dividing your monthly payment by 12, and adding that amount to your payment every month;###"}
{"prompt":"Is there a limit on how much my mortgage lender can make me pay into an escrow account for interest and taxes?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes, if your loan is a federally related mortgage loan under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), there is a limit on how much the lender can make you pay into an escrow account.  While an escrow account is not required for every loan, it can be an important protection for you because it helps make sure you have the money you need to pay taxes and insurance when they are due. Failing to pay taxes and insurance can result in additional costs and fees and even lead to foreclosure. If you have an escrow account with your mortgage, you generally will have to pay a certain amount into escrow at closing, as a part of your \"cash to close\". You may also have to pay into your escrow account an amount for taxes and insurance as part of your regular mortgage payment. If your loan is a federally related mortgage loan under RESPA, then there are limits on how much a lender can make you pay, both at closing and in your recurring mortgage payments. Before your loan closes, the lender will estimate the total annual expenses that need to be paid from the escrow account. They can require you to pay a part of the estimated annual total in advance, but only enough to make sure that the escrow account never carries a negative balance, plus an additional two months' worth of estimated disbursements to serve as a cushion. On top of these amounts, every month, your mortgage servicer can require you to pay up to one-twelfth of the total annual escrow payments that they reasonably anticipate paying out of the escrow account. For most mortgages with an escrow account, the loan servicer must provide an initial and annual escrow account statement that shows the account history and a projection of activity for the next year. If you have a loan that's considered \"higher-priced\" under the Truth in Lending Act then you might be required to pay into an escrow account for at least the first five years of the loan. Some loan types require escrow for the entire term of the loan. You'll be notified by the lender or servicer if your loan is in this category, or if there's an exception that applies to you.

{"prompt":"Is there any reason my mortgage payment would change over the life of my loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. One reason may be that you have an adjustable rate loan. In this type of loan, the payments can go up or down, based on the terms of the agreement that you signed. Some people have interest-only loans or pay option loans. With these loans, the borrower can postpone making principal payments for a while. Eventually, though, the borrower has to start paying principal and that will make the monthly payments go up. Even if you have a fixed rate loan, your payments may change if you are paying your taxes and insurance through an escrow account maintained by your servicer. If there is a change in your property taxes, the escrow portion of your monthly payment may go up. An increase in your homeowner's insurance rates also will increase your escrow payment. If you have mortgage insurance, your payments may change once you are able to and do in fact cancel the insurance.###"}
{"prompt":"Are there situations where I would not have a right of rescission?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The right of rescission does not apply in every case where your home is used as collateral for the loan. For example, you do not have the right of rescission when: Your loan is used to purchase or build your principal home; You consolidate or refinance with the same creditor a loan that is already secured by your home, and no additional funds are borrowed; A state agency is the creditor for the loan;###"}
{"prompt":"My lender or broker never provided me with the notice of a right to rescind for a mortgage loan. What can I do?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you never received the Truth-in-Lending disclosure or the Notice of Right to Rescind from the lender and you were entitled to receive one, you may still be able to rescind your mortgage loan. However, this must happen during the first three years after you sign the mortgage contract, or before you sell your home - whichever occurs first. If you think you need to rescindyour mortgage loan on this basis, you may want to consult an attorney. Remember, you will have to give back the money that you borrowed if you rescind the loan. Note:In most cases, if you apply for a mortgage on or after October 3, 2015, you will receive a Closing Disclosureas your finalTruth-in-Lending disclosure.

{"prompt":"Can I ever waive my right to rescind on my mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. You can waive your right of rescission (your right to cancel your transaction within three business days for your refinance or home equity line of credit). If you have a \"bona fide personal financial emergency\". However, if you waive yourright of rescission, you might lose your right to rescind the mortgage transaction (unless there is proof of fraud.). You must give the lender your own written statement (pre-printed forms are not allowed) describing the emergency and clearly stating that you are waiving your right to rescind. The statement must be dated and signed by you and anyone else who shares in the ownership of the home. Tip: If you have a problem with your mortgage closing process, you should discuss the issue or matter with your lender. If you're having issues with your mortgage, you can also submit a complaint to the CFPBonlineor by calling. We'll forward your complaint to the company and work to get you a response.

{"prompt":"How long do I have to rescind? When does the right of rescission start?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you are buying a home with a mortgage, you do not have a right to cancel the loan once the closing documents are signed. If you are refinancing a mortgage, you have until midnight of the third business day after the transaction to rescind (cancel) the mortgage contract. The right of rescission refers to the right of a consumer to cancel certain types of loans. If you are refinancing a mortgage, and you want to rescind (cancel) your mortgage contract; the three-day clock does not start until all three of the following events have happened: You sign the credit contract (usually known as the Promissory Note); You receive a Truth in Lending disclosure (in most circumstances, this will be your Closing Disclosure form); You receive two copies of a notice explaining your right to rescind; The first business day after the last of these events counts as day one. For rescission purposes, business days include Saturdays, but not Sundays or legal public holidays. For example, if the last of the above three events occurs on a Friday, and there are no legal public holidays in between, then you have until midnight on the following Tuesday to rescind. You may use the form provided to you by the lender or write a letter. Whatever form of written notice you use, make sure it is mailed or delivered before midnight of the third business day. Keep a copy and any evidence that it was mailed or delivered on time. If you did not receive your Truth in Lending disclosure or the notice of your right to rescind, or if they were incorrect, you may be able to rescind your loan up to three years from the date of closing. If you think this situation may apply to you, consult an attorney.###"}
{"prompt":"Can I change my mind after I sign the loan closing documents for my second mortgage or refinance? What is the \"right of rescission\"?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Yes. For certain types of mortgages, after you sign your mortgage closing documents, you may be able to change your mind.  You have the right to cancel, also known as the right of rescission, for most non-purchase money mortgages. A non-purchase money mortgage is a mortgage that is not used to buy the home. Refinances and home equity loans are examples of non-purchase money mortgages. This right gives youthree business daysto cancel a non-purchase money mortgage agreement. In this case, business days include Saturdays, but not Sundays or legal public holidays.

You may use the form provided to you by your lender or a letter. You can't rescind just by calling or visiting the lender. Within 20 calendar days after your lender receives your notice of rescission, all money or property you paid as part of the mortgage transaction must be returned to you. In some cases, if the lender doesn't give you your Truth-in-Lending disclosure (which in most cases will be a Closing Disclosure) or two copies of the notice of the right to cancel, or if the lender makes certain important mistakes on your Truth-in-Lending disclosure, you may have the right to cancel the loan for up to three years. If you think this may apply to you, you should consult a lawyer right away. Note: If you applied for your mortgage on or after October 3, 2015, in most casesyour Truth-in-Lending disclosure will be the Closing Disclosure. Tip: Whatever form of written notice you use, make sure it is delivered or mailed before midnight of the third business day after your closing and keep a copy for yourself. Warning: Your right to rescind doesn't change your obligation to make payments on any of your other loans. If you refinance and then rescind the refinance loan, you will still have to pay the original loan. Tip: If you have the right to rescind, you can cancel your loan in the three-day window for any reason or no reason at all.###"}

{"prompt":"At the mortgage loan closing, do I have to sign if I don't like the terms?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No. You don't have to sign anything unless you're satisfied with theterms. Warning: You should never sign anything that you don't understand. Don't sign if you don't understand the mortgagetermsor if you think that you won't be able to pay back the loan. If you are borrowing money to buy a home, you likely have a contract with the seller. The contract may limit the amount of time and flexibility you have to close the sale. The contract may also subject you to legal action if you break it. Review your contract or seek the advice of an attorney to determine what options you have if you decide not to take the home loan offered for the closing. You may be able to secure a new mortgage or extend the period to close the sale. However, if you can't do so, you may lose the deposit you paid to the seller when you entered into an agreement to buy their home. The seller may have other legal rights against you. If you have a contract with the seller, review the \"mortgage of financing clause\" in your sales contract. This will tell you whether your deposit will be refunded if the sale is cancelled because you are unable to get a loan. Tip: If you are in the process of refinancing your existing mortgage, you don't have any contractual obligation to sign the documents. If you have a problem with your mortgage closing process, you should discuss the issue or matter with your lender.

{"prompt":"What do I do if the rate or fees are different on my Closing Disclosure than they were on my Loan Estimate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  First, ask your lender for a specific reason why your rate or fees have changed. The mortgage closing costs may be different if something important changed or wasn't included in your Loan Estimate. It's also possible that your income or assets turned out to be different from what you estimated when you first applied. It's not uncommon for some closing costs to change somewhat, but there are legal rules about what can change and by how much. Learn which fees can change and which can't. If you have a rate lock, your rate and points should not change, but there are exceptions. Rate locks typically only guarantee your rate if nothing changes about your application. If something important changes - for example, the home is appraised at less than the sale price, or your lender cannot verify your income - then your rate may change. If you have a rate lock and your rate has changed, ask your lender to explain why. Learn more about how rate locks work. If you're not satisfied with your lender's explanation, you can always stop working with that lender. If the rate or fees have changed significantly, and you are unable to reach an acceptable solution with your lender, consider other options. You can choose another lender. You may be able to negotiate with the seller to delay the closing until you can arrange for a new loan with a different lender. Even if you decide to work with a different lender, you may have rights to compensation from the first lender if the changes they made were illegal. You may want to consider contacting an attorney.

{"prompt":"What do I do if the terms of my mortgage loan at closing are not what I was promised beforehand?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Don't sign the closing documents if the loan is not what you were promised. You don't have to sign anything at closing unless you are satisfied with the terms. The lender owes you an explanation of why the terms have changed. Don't sign any papers until you are satisfied with the terms as written in the documents. There are always other options. If you are refinancing, then you can renegotiate with the lender, or cancel the closing and look for a new lender. If you are using the mortgage to buy a new home, you still have options. You can ask the lender why you are not being given the loan you were promised and insist upon the promised terms. You can also negotiate with the seller for more time to find a new lender. However, your purchase contract with the seller may limit the amount of time you have to purchase the home. There may also be legal or financial consequences if you break the promises you made in the contract with the seller. Walking away from a purchase loan closing isn't easy, but it may be preferable to agreeing to a loan that is more expensive than what you were promised. Explore your options. Review your sales contract and consult with an attorney or trusted advisor. You might ask the seller for more time so that you can negotiate with the lender or find a new lender. Never sign any papers until you're satisfied that you understand what has changed and why, and that you can afford the new loan terms.###"}

Note: You won't receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.

{"prompt":"Can a lender make me provide documents like my W-2 or pay stub in order to give me a Loan Estimate?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A lender or mortgage broker cannot require you to provide any documents as a condition for providing you with a Loan Estimate. To receive a Loan Estimate, you need to submit only six key pieces of information: Your name; Your income; Your Social Security number (so the lender can check your credit); The address of the home you plan to purchase or refinance; An estimate of the home's value; The loan amount you want to borrow; Although you're not required to provide documents to get a Loan Estimate, it's a good idea to share what you have with the lender. The more information the lender has, the more accurate your Loan Estimate will be. Once you receive a Loan Estimate, you need to choose whether you would like to proceed with the loan application. Once you've notified the lender that you would like to proceed with an application, the lender may require you to provide additional information and documents to verify the information you have already submitted. If your verification documents show different information than what you already provided, you may receive a revised Loan Estimate. Tip: The best way to get a good deal on a mortgage that's right for you is to request Loan Estimates from multiple lenders and compare offers. Learn more about how to shop for a mortgage. Note: You won't receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate. The rules for a GFE are different - lenders may require additional information beyond the six items listed above in order to provide you with a GFE, but they still may not require any documentation. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.###"}

{"prompt":"A friend asked me to be a co-signer on a mortgage loan. What does that mean?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you cosign a loan, you are responsible for the payments if the primary borrower does not pay.

{"prompt":"What should I do if I'm having problems with my escrow or impound account?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you're having problems with your escrow or impound account, contact your mortgage servicer right away. You may need to send an information request or notice of error. An escrow account is an account set up by your mortgage lender to pay certain property-related expenses on your behalf, like property taxes and homeowners insurance. It's set up to help you pay these expenses through your lender or servicer, little by little every month, instead of you getting a big bill once or twice a year. An escrow account is sometimes called an impound account. Learn more about how escrow accounts work. Your property taxes and insurance premiums can change from year to year. If your property taxes and\/or insurance premiums change, your total monthly payment will change. It's a good idea to keep a close eye on your mortgage statements, and any tax and insurance bills, to be able to spot quickly if there are problems with your escrow account. Signs that there could be an issue with your escrow account include: Changes in your total monthly payment without being notified that your taxes or insurance premiums are going to change; Servicer-purchased force-placed insurance, which your servicer is allowed to purchase and charge you for under certain circumstances; A notice from your local government that your property taxes haven't been paid; If you notice any of the changes above, the first thing you should do is contact your servicer to verify that these changes aren't due to a mistake on their end. If you have a problem with your mortgage, you can submit a complaint to the CFPB onlineby calling.###"}
{"prompt":"What happens if I have a reverse mortgage and I want to sell my home?\nX0X\n","completion":"  When you sell your home your reverse mortgage loan will need to be paid back. If you decide to sell your home while you have a reverse mortgage loan, you will have to pay back the money you borrowed plus interest and fees. If your loan balance is less than the amount you sell your home for, then you keep the difference. If your loan balance is more than the amount you sell your home for and you sell your home for the appraised value, the money from the sale will go towards the outstanding loan balance and any remaining balance of the loan is paid for by mortgage insurance. If your reverse mortgage loan is in default and you've received a notice that the loan is \"due and payable,\" you may sell your home for 95 percent of its appraised value. The money from the sale will then go towards the outstanding loan balance and any remaining balance of the loan is paid for by mortgage insurance. Note: This information only applies to Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), which are the most common type of reverse mortgage loan.###"}
{"prompt":"How do home insurance companies pay out claims?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If your home is damaged, your home insurance company will send out an adjuster to look at the damage. The company will then determine your settlement amount or how much you'll be reimbursed to make repairs. A homeowner's insurancepolicy pays for losses or damage to your property if something unexpected happens. Once the insurance company sends an adjuster and evaluates the damage to your home, they'll pay a settlement amount in either replacement cost or actual cash value. Replacement cost gives you funds to cover the costs to rebuild your home or repair damages using similar materials. Actual cash value gives you funds to repair or rebuild based on the value of your home, considering its age and condition or market value. Keep in mind that the market value of your home may not match the replacement value. That's because, in some locations, the materials and labor that go into rebuilding your home may be less than the overall value of your property. Your homeowner's insurance company will likely pay your settlement with a check made out to both you and your mortgage servicer or lender. Most mortgage agreements require this to protect the lender's interest. Typically, your servicer will release a portion of the settlement money before work begins so you canhire a contractor. As the work progresses, the servicer will typically release more money. The rest will be released once the job is finished and the home passes inspection. If you have a mortgage, you will still be responsible for making your payments while your insurance claim is paid out. Learn what to do if you're having trouble making mortgage payments due to a disaster or other emergency.###"}
{"prompt":"Is a lender allowed to consider my age or where my income comes from when deciding whether to give me a loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No, a creditor such as a lender is generally not allowed to make credit decisions based on your age alone. Lenders are not allowed to refuse to consider income from your part-time employment, pension, and certain other sources. A lender generally can't deny your loan application or charge you higher interest rates or fees because of your age. This rule applies to various types of lenders when they're deciding whether to give credit, such as an auto loan, credit card, mortgage, student loan, or small business loan. Here are some exceptions: A lender can refuse to lend money to someone who is too young to enter into a legal contract. State law controls the legal contract age and this may vary depending on the type of contract. Age can be used as part of a valid credit scoring system as long as it does not disfavor applicants 62 years old or older. Valid credit scoring systems may favor applicants 62 years or older. A lender may relate your age to other information they use to decide if you are creditworthy. For example, a lender or dealer may consider your job and length of time to retirement to determine whether your income, including your retirement income, will be adequate for the life of the loan. Lenders are not allowed to discount or refuse to consider income that comes from: Part-time employment; An annuity, pension, or other retirement benefit; A public assistance program. This includes, but is not limited to, social security and supplemental security income (SSI), social security disability insurance (SSDI), unemployment compensation, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Like all other forms of income, however, a lender can consider the amount of the income and likelihood that it will continue.

Your home may be \"underwater\" if you owe more on your mortgage than what your home is worth. Usually, if you sell your home for less than you owe on your mortgage, you still must pay the rest of what you owe on the mortgage. Many mortgage servicers treat the receipt of PCS orders as a \"qualifying hardship\". This means that you may be able to receive help through certain loss mitigation programs, such as a short sale program, even if you are current on your mortgage payments. For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offer a short sale program for servicemembers with PCS orders. If your loan is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you purchased your home on or before June 30, 2012, and you successfully sell it through a short sale approved by your servicer, you will not be required to pay back any remaining loan balance. Your loan obligation will be satisfied by the proceeds from the sale. If your loan isn't owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, similar programs still might be available to you. As soon as you receive PCS orders, contact your loan servicer. Tell them you have PCS orders, ask what programs are available, and ask how to apply.

When you - and any co-borrower(s) or an eligible non-borrowing spouse as applicable - have passed away, your reverse mortgage loan becomes due and payable. Your heirs have 30 days from receiving the due and payable notice from the lender to buy, sell, or turn the home over to the lender to satisfy the debt. This is the case for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), which are the most common type of reverse mortgage loan. However, it may be possible for the timeline to be extended up to six months so your heirs can sell the home or obtain financing to purchase the home. Your heirs can consult a HUD-approved housing counseling agency or an attorney for more information. If your heirs need to sell the home Some heirs may lack funds to pay off the loan balance and may need to sell the home to repay the reverse mortgage loan. If the loan balance is less than the home value, your heirs can use the sale proceeds to repay the loan and keep the difference. If the balance owed on the loan is more than what the home is worth, your heirs can sell the home for at least 95 percent of the current appraised value in order to pay off the loan. The remaining balance of the loan is covered by the mortgage insurance that the reverse mortgage borrower paid during the duration of the loan. If your heirs want to keep the home If your heirs would like to keep your home instead of selling it, they must pay it off with another source of funds. The loan balance will need to be paid in full. How to prepare If you have a reverse mortgage loan and want to leave your home to your children, it's important to talk to them now about their repayment options. You may also want to consider talking to a professional about creating an estate plan. Learn more about reverse mortgages###"}
{"prompt":"Are there any different requirements for same-sex spouses jointly applying for a VA Loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No. The VA does not differentiate between same-sex and opposite-sex spouses when processing claims and applications. Spousal status is evaluated the same for all borrowers, with the borrower(s) simply indicating their marital status on the application and related loan documents. No extra documentation is required, other than the borrower's assertion that they're married, for verification of marital status. Veterans interested in learning more about the VA loan process can review the VA's Circular on the topic. Veterans applying for a VA loan with a co-borrower who is not their spouse (regardless of sex), could face different loan underwriting requirements than veterans who apply for a VA loan with their spouse.###"}
{"prompt":"My lender says it can't lend to me because of a limit on points and fees on loans. Is this true?\nX0X\n","completion":"  No. There are two things the CFPB's mortgagerules require lenders to do: document and determine your ability to repay the loan. The mortgage rules only stop a lender from making a loan when the borrower does not have the ability to repay the loan. However, some lenders may choose to comply with the ability-to-repay ruleby making only \"Qualified Mortgages,\" which do have caps on upfront points and fees. To make sure borrowers don't pay very high fees, a lender making a Qualified Mortgage can only charge up to the following upfront points and fees: For a loan of $100,000 or more: 3% of the total loan amount or less. For a loan of $60,000 to $100,000: $3,000 or less. For a loan of $20,000 to $60,000: 5% of the total loan amount or less. For a loan of $12,500 to $20,000: $1,000 or less. For a loan of $12,500 or less: 8% of the total loan amount or less. Under the CFPB's rules, only Qualified Mortgages have a limit on points and fees. Lenders are not required to make Qualified Mortgages, so they can charge higher points and fees if they choose.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the ability-to-repay rule? Why is it important to me?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The ability-to-repay rule is the reasonable and good faith determinationmost mortgage lenders are required to make that you are able to pay back the loan. Under the rule, lenders must generally find out, consider, and document a borrower's income, assets, employment, credit history and monthly expenses. Lenders cannot just use an introductory or \"teaser\" rate to figure out if a borrower can repay a loan. For example, if a mortgage has a low interest rate that goes up in later years, the lender has to make a reasonable effort to figure out if the borrower can pay the higher interest rate too. One way a lender can follow the ability-to-repay rule is by making a \"Qualified Mortgage\".###"}

{"prompt":"Does a lender or broker have to consider my part-time or retirement income?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A creditor such as a lender or broker cannot discount or refuse to consider your (or yourspouse's) income because it comes from part-time employment. A lender or broker also cannot discount or refuse to consider income that is an annuity, pension, or other retirement benefit. Like all other forms of income, however, a lender or broker can consider the amount of the income and likelihood that it will continue.###"}
{"prompt":"I want to apply for a mortgage or home equity loan. Can a lender or broker ask me about my children or dependents?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A creditor such as a lender or broker may ask about the number and ages of your dependents. A lender or broker may also ask about dependent-related financial obligations or expenses. However, a lender or broker may do so only if the creditor asks for this information without regard to sex or marital status (or any other prohibited basis). A lender or broker cannot ask you about your birth control practices. A lender or broker also cannot ask about your intentions concerning having or raising children or your capability to have children. Further, a lender or broker is prohibited from discriminating in a mortgage or home equity loan because of familial status. Familial status means one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with a parent or another person having legal custody of the individual or individuals, or the designee of such parent or other person having such custody, with the written permission of such parent or other person.

{"prompt":"Can a lender or broker consider my sex or marital status when deciding whether to give me a mortgage or home equity loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A creditor such as a lender or broker cannot discriminate on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity) or marital status. With respect to most mortgage transactions, a lender or broker may ask for your sex, but only to support compliance with anti-discrimination laws. If you are applying for joint credit or credit secured by collateral (like a mortgage or home equity loan), the lender or broker may only ask if you are married, unmarried, or separated. The lender or broker may explain that the unmarried category includes single, divorced, and widowed persons. Lenders can't require married same-sex couples to provide different documentation of their marriage than married opposite-sex couples. A lender or broker may consider your marital status as it affects the creditor's ability to reach the property in the event of nonpayment. For example, for mortgage and home equity loans, a creditor could consider whether your spouse has an interest in the property that is being offered as collateral for the loan.###"}
{"prompt":"Can a lender or broker consider the fact that I am not a citizen of the United States?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A creditor such as a lender or broker cannot discriminate on the basis of national origin. However, a lender or broker may ask about your permanent residency and immigration status. A lender or broker may consider this information or any additional information that may affect its rights and remedies regarding repayment. A lender or broker may also take into account any law, regulation, or executive order that limits dealings with citizens of certain countries.###"}

{"prompt":"Can a lender or broker consider whether I receive income from a public assistance program when deciding whether to give me a mortgage or home equity loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  A creditor such as a lender or broker cannot discriminate against you because you receive public assistance income. Like any other income, a lender or broker may consider whether your public assistance income is likely to continue. If your income is not likely to continue, that fact can be considered in determining your creditworthiness.###"}
{"prompt":"Can a lender or broker consider my age when deciding whether to give me a mortgage or home equity loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Generally, a creditor such as a lender or broker cannot use your age to make credit decisions. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, age can be considered in a valid credit scoring system. Even then, the credit scoring system may not disfavor applicants 62 years old or older. The scoring system may favor applicants 62 years or older. In addition, a lender or broker may relate your age to other information about you that the lender or broker considers in evaluating creditworthiness. For example, a lender may consider your job and length of time to retirement to determine whether your income (including your retirement income) will be adequate for the life of the loan.###"}

{"prompt":"What was the National Mortgage Settlement?\nX0X\n","completion":"  In February 2012, 49 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, and the federal government entered into the largest consumer financial protection settlement in U. S. history with what were then the nation's five largest mortgage servicers. The agreement settled state and federal claims against Ally\/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo that they routinely signed foreclosure related documents without knowing if they were correct, a practice referred to at the time as \"Robo-signing\". The settlement provided over $50 billion in relief to distressed borrowers harmed by the wrongful foreclosures and direct payments to the states and the federal government. The settlement included relief to servicemembers who were wrongfully foreclosed upon or charged higher interest rates in violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or forced to sell their home at loss due to Permanent Change of Station (PSC) orders. Similar settlements were later made with HSBC, Ocwen and Suntrust. The CFPB was a party to these later settlements. The payments owed by servicers to consumers under these settlements were administered by an independent monitor. As of December 31, 2016 the monitor reported that all eligible consumers had received claim checks with the exception of some HSBC customers whose claim checks will be mailed in early 2017.

{"prompt":"How can I find the loan limit for an FHA loan in my county?\nX0X\n","completion":"   You can check the loan limit for FHA mortgage loans in your county on the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website. If you're interested in getting a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, knowing the maximum loan amount for your county will help you when shopping for homes and negotiating with sellers. Tip: To use this tool, choose your state from the drop-down menu, type in your county, and change the \"Limit Type\" drop-down to \"FHA Forward\". Leave all of the other inputs alone and click \"send\". In the resulting table, the number in the \"One-Family\" column is the conforming loan limit in your county. Loan limits are higher if you are purchasing a home with multiple units (for example, a duplex where you plan to live in one unit and rent the other unit out). The building must have no more than four units and you must purchase the entire building to be eligible. To look up these higher multiple-unit loan limits, follow the instructions above and instead look at the column that corresponds to the number of units (called \"families\" in the table) that you plan to purchase.###"}
{"prompt":"I'm about to close on a mortgage. What should I do before, during, and after the mortgage closing?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Make sure you're prepared for each step of the closing. Follow the steps below, and download ourclosing checklist. Before the closing Make sure you receive your closing documents in advance (either electronic or paper copies) so that you can review them. Your lender is required to send you your Closing Disclosure at least three business days before closing, and you can request the rest of your closing documents in advance. It's especially important for you to review the Closing Disclosure, the promissory note, mortgage, initial escrow disclosure, and the notice of right to cancel for refinances. Carefully review all documents that you receive to make sure that the terms of your mortgage have not changed without your knowledge. For example, compare the closing cost items listed on your Loan Estimate to those on the Closing Disclosure. Make sure your closing costs have not increased by more than what is allowed. Ask your lender or settlement agent about any fees you do not understand. You should also review the Closing Disclosure to ensure that the payments are what you expected. Your promissory note further describes your legal obligations. Make any arrangements to transition from your current home to your new home. This includes signing up for essential services like gas, electric, or water connections. You don't have to do this at closing, but may want to contact the providers a few days prior to closing.###"}
{"prompt":"How can I get an electronic periodic mortgage statement?\nX0X\n","completion":"  If you want to receive yourmortgage statementelectronically, tell your mortgage servicer. The CFPB doesn't prohibit servicers from sending periodic mortgage statements electronically, as long as your servicer has your consent.

{"prompt":"How do I tell if I have a fixed or adjustable rate mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  There are several ways to tell if you have a fixed or adjustable rate mortgage. 1. Call your servicer. Your servicer is the company that you send your mortgage payments to each month. Their phone number may be listed on your monthly mortgage statement or payment coupons. 2. Check the disclosures that you received when you got your loan If you applied for your mortgage after October 3, 2015: Look at your Closing Disclosure. The type of interest rate is listed at the top of page 1. See a sample Closing Disclosure. If you applied for your mortgage before October 3, 2015, or if you have a reverse mortgage, HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs: Look at your Truth in Lending Disclosure statement. Look for language along these lines: \"Your loan contains a variable-rate feature. Disclosures about the variable-rate feature have been provided to you earlier\". If similar language is on the disclosure, you have an adjustable rate mortgage. 3. Check the papers that you signed at closing Look at the paper that says \"Promissory Note\" or \"Note\". If you have an adjustable rate mortgage, your note may have the words \"Adjustable Rate Note\" and may include language similar to: \"The interest rate I will pay will change in accordance with Section __ of this Note\".###"}
{"prompt":"How can I determine how long it will take me to pay off my mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  The amount of time that you will have to repay your mortgage is called the loan term.

For those loans, you will receive two forms - a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure - instead of a Loan Estimate. Instead of a Closing Disclosure, you will receive a final Truth in Lending disclosure and a HUD -1 Settlement Statement. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.###"}
{"prompt":"What do I have to do to apply for a mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  To apply for a mortgage loan, you will have to provide a lender with personal financial information and information about the house you want to finance. The first step of applying for a mortgage is to request a Loan Estimate from three or more lenders. To receive a Loan Estimate, you need to submit only six key pieces of information: Your name; Your income; Your Social Security number (so the lender can check your credit); The address of the home you plan to purchase or refinance; An estimate of the home's value; The loan amount you want to borrow; Although you're not required to provide documents in order to get a Loan Estimate, it's a good idea to share what you have with the lender(s). The more information the lender has, the more accurate your Loan Estimate will be. Tip: It's a good idea to request Loan Estimates from several lenders. That way, you can compare your options and choose the best loan for you. Each lender is required to send you a Loan Estimate within three business days of receiving your six key pieces of information. Once you're ready to choose a loan offer, you need to notify the lender that you are ready to proceed with the loan application. If you don't notify a lender that you'd like to proceed within 10 business days, the lender may revise the Loan Estimate or close your application as incomplete and you may need to start over. The 10 business days are calculated from when the lender delivers the Loan Estimate to you or places it in the mail, whichever is earlier. Once you've notified the lender that you would like to proceed with an application, the lender may ask you to provide additional information and documents to verify the information you have already submitted. The lender processes this information and may follow up with you to request additional information or clarification. Once the lender has received all the necessary information, the lender approves or denies your loan application.###"}
{"prompt":"How do I find the best loan available when I'm shopping for a home mortgage loan?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Shopping around for a mortgage loan will help you get the best deal. Start with an internet search, or contact banks, credit unions, and other lenders and brokers in your area.  The internet is a good place to start your search. By doing a broad online search for mortgage rates in your area, you will get a good sense of the market. Next, contact banks, credit unions, or other lenders and mortgage brokers in your area. Ask each lender or broker you call for: A list of current interest rates for their available mortgage loans and whether the rates being quoted are the lowest for that day or week. What fees the lender normally charges for each loan product. Each loan's annual percentage rate (APR). The APR tells you the yearly cost of the loan based on the interest rate as well as points, broker fees, and certain other charges that you may be required to pay, including certain closing costs. Whether the rates given for various products are fixed or adjustable, and what points or fees go along with different rates. Sometimes you can get a better rate if you pay \"points\" or additional fees. But make sure that you actually get a lower interest rate in exchange for the extra points you pay. There are many different types of mortgage loans available, so be sure you understand all of your options. If you are a veteran or service member, you may qualify for a VA loan. If you have concerns about your credit history or only have enough to make a smaller down payment, you may qualify for an FHA loan. With all of the options out there, it is important to shop around and take the time to understand the terms of the different loans offered to you. It's a good idea to request loan estimates from at least three different lenders and compare them to choose the best loan for you. Tip: Ask these questions to better understand your loan offer: Is the interest rate fixed or adjustable?. ; Do I need to pay points?. ; What fees will I have to pay?. Will I pay those myself or will the lender loan the fees to me?. ; What is the term of the loan?. ; How much willmy paymentbe and will it eventually pay off my principal?. ; What other costs will be added to my monthly payment?. ; Can I repay the loan early without penalty?. ; Will the payments change over the life of the loan?. How high can my payment go?. ; For an adjustable rate mortgage, are the payment adjustments and the interest rate capped?. ; How much will I need to put down?. ; Does the written offer match what I was told about the loan?. ;.###"}

{"prompt":"How can I figure out if I can afford to buy a home and take out a mortgage?\nX0X\n","completion":"  Focus on a mortgage that is affordable for you given your other priorities, not how much you qualify for. Lenders will often tell you how much you are qualified to borrow - that is, how much they are willing to loan you. Several online calculators will compare your income and debts and come up with similar answers based on standard ratios. But how much you could borrow is very different from how much you can afford to repay without stretching your budget for other important items too thin. Lenders do not take into account all your family and financial circumstances. To know how much you can afford to repay, you'll need to take a hard look at your family's income, expenses and savings priorities to see what fits comfortably within your budget. Also, remember that your monthly payment could change in the future, depending on what type of mortgage loan you have. Consider how future, higher mortgage payments will fit in with your budget. Don't forget other mortgage- and home-related costs when determining your ideal payment. Homeowner's insurance, property taxes, and possibly private mortgage insurance or homeowners association fees are typically added to your monthly mortgage payment, so be sure to include these costs when calculating how much you can afford. There may also be costs for repairs and maintenance of your home. You can get estimates from your insurance agent, local tax assessor, homeowners association, and lender. Knowing how much you can comfortably pay each month will also help you estimate a reasonable price range for your new home. Tip: Don't sacrifice savings in order to buy a bigger house. When reviewing your budget to determine an affordable mortgage payment, don't forget about your savings. You likely will still need to save for emergencies, retirement, college for the children, and other priorities even after you're a homeowner. Consider adding more money to your emergency fund or household fund to avoid going into debt to pay for sudden repairs, expensive replacements, or other necessities.

{"prompt":"How can I find the loan limit for a conforming loan in my county?\nX0X\n","completion":"  You can check the loan limit for a conforming mortgage loan in your county on the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)'s website. To find the conforming loan limit for your county useHUD's tool to check loan limits. To filter for your county: Choose your state from the drop-down menu; Type in your county, and change the \"Limit Type\" drop-down to \"Fannie\/Freddie\"; Leave all of the other inputs alone; Click \"send\"; In the resulting table, the number in the \"One-Family\" column is the conforming loan limit in your county. Knowing the loan limit is helpful when shopping for homes and negotiating with sellers, so you can know whether a particular home might require you to make a higher down payment or get ajumbo loaninstead. A conforming loan is one that can be guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, also known as the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs). By law, the GSEs are only allowed to guarantee loans up to a certain amount. In most counties, that limit is $726,200 for a single-family home or condo. In some counties where home prices are particularly high, there are higher loan limits. In these high-cost counties the limit can go up to $1,089,300. These loans are known as \"conforming jumbo\" loans because they are part of the conforming program, but the loan limit is higher. Loan limits are also higher if you are purchasing a home with multiple units (for example, a duplex in where you plan to live in one unit and rent the other unit out). The building must have no more than four units and you must purchase the entire building to be eligible (if you're buying just one unit in a condo building, the regular loan limits apply). To look up these higher multiple-unit loan limits, follow the instructions above and instead look at the column that corresponds to the number of units (called \"families\" in the table) that you plan to purchase.###"}
